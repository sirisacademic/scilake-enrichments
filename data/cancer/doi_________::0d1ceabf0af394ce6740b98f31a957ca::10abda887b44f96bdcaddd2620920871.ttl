        nif:anchorOf              "To our knowledge, this is the rst study conducted in Oman to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer, associated factors, and to describe changes occurring over time. Our ndings revealed that a high number of children and adolescents with cancer in Oman exhibit symptoms of anxiety (43.5%), depression (56.5%), and PTSD (32.6%) within the rst three months of diagnosis. Prevalence rates of these psychological disorders, especially anxiety and depression, were notably higher compared to the pooled rates reported in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of previous literature (13.92%, 20.43%, and 20.90%, respectively) [8]. However, these differences might be attributed to variations in the measurement and screening tools used across different studies. Alternatively, another explanation for the high prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms observed in our study could be linked to the lack of specialized or psychosocial supportive care for cancer patients in Oman, particularly at the time of diagnosis [22]. This is likely exacerbated by the fact that, in certain Arab cultures, including in Oman, there remains considerable stigma surrounding mental health issues, posing a challenge for individuals to actively seek or obtain psychological support [23,24]. Moreover, limitations in healthcare resources, such as a shortage of mental health professionals, may further hinder access to psychological support services for cancer patients [23]. Finally, a lack of widespread awareness regarding the signi cance of psychological support for cancer patients, particularly children and adolescents, could contribute to a shortage of available programs and services [25]. We also found that symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer decreased over time; these ndings are supported by other longitudinal studies [26][27][28]. Other research has shown that a healthy family environment is a strong protective factor against the development of these disorders, as well as improving the quality of life of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer [29,30]. In Oman, support extended by family members and friends to cancer patients has been observed to signi cantly reduce mental distress and alleviate the adverse side-effects associated with cancer treatment [22]. Moreover, cancer patients in Oman have been shown to develop various coping mechanisms and adaptive strategies to deal with the emotional impacts of a cancer diagnosis, including denial, optimism, withdrawal, and a strong reliance on Islamic beliefs and practices [31]. These factors likely play a role in decreasing psychological distress over time. The results of our study indicated that the child's age had a signi cant impact on their anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores, with adolescents exhibiting a higher likelihood of experiencing these conditions compared to children. Other studies have also highlighted a notable increase in major depressive episodes during the transition to adolescence [32,33]. This nding aligns with the understanding that adolescence is marked by hormonal changes and an enhanced ability to comprehend emotions [34]. Moreover, adolescents with cancer may face substantial disruptions to their education, potentially missing school due to the demands of treatment and recovery [35]. Repercussions may extend beyond academic skills, encompassing a range of missed opportunities, such as participation in sports, group activities, excursions, and award ceremonies, as well as the absence of daily structure and routine provided in the scholastic environment [36]. Prolonged absences from school and limited peer interaction can contribute to the development of emotional, behavioural, and psychological challenges [36,37]. We also found that children and adolescents who were informed of their diagnosis exhibited signi cantly higher anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores compared to those who remained unaware of their condition. The relationship between disclosure of a cancer diagnosis and mental health outcomes is complex, and individual reactions can vary widely. Some children and adolescents may bene t from being informed, as this allows them to be more actively involved in their own care and treatment decision-making, while others may nd comfort in not knowing the full extent of their illness [38]. Fundamentally, awareness of a cancer diagnosis results in a deeper cognitive understanding of illness severity, the side-effects of treatment, social stigma, and health uncertainties, all of which can increase anxiety and stress [39]. However, in Omani culture, it is routine for some parents and family members to try to protect their loved ones or keep their hopes up by choosing to withhold knowledge of their diagnosis [22]. Our ndings showed that high-risk patients had signi cantly higher PTSD scores during the rst three months of diagnosis. Patients with more aggressive types of cancer often require more intensive and invasive treatment regimens, such as surgery and radiation, resulting in long periods of hospitalization, all of which may contribute to increased stress, anxiety, and trauma [40]. Furthermore, the aggressive nature of the cancer and its associated treatment can create a sense of uncertainty about the future, including treatment outcomes and the potential for relapse [41]. Indeed, the physical and emotional toll of aggressive cancer can be overwhelming as a result of the sideeffects of treatment, including changes in physical appearance and disruptions to daily life, factors which can contribute to symptoms of depression [42]. The results of our study should be considered in the light of certain limitations. The study involved a prospective, crosssectional design in which Omani children and adolescents were screened for symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD at two separate time intervals following diagnosis. The length of time between these intervals might not have been adequate to track dynamic changes in anxiety and PTSD over time, thereby limiting our understanding of the longterm psychological effects of cancer diagnoses. An extended study period with more frequent assessments could have potentially enabled a more in-depth exploration of the psychological challenges faced by children and adolescents at different points in their cancer experiences. In addition, information regarding anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms was self-assessed by the participants; such self-reporting is susceptible to various biases, including memory recall in uenced by the passage of time, emotional states, and individual differences in cognitive processing. Thus, the participants may have unintentionally provided inaccurate or incomplete information regarding their psychological experiences, leading to potential discrepancies between reported and actual symptoms." ;

Descriptive statistics, including percentages, frequencies, means, and standard deviations, were used to delineate the participants' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as their average anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores. Paired t-tests and McNemar's tests were utilised to assess differences in average anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores between the two time points. Analysis of variance and independent sample t-tests were employed to assess variations between the dependent variable (average anxiety, depression, or PTSD scores) and independent variables (sociodemographic and clinical characteristics). Pearson's Chi-squared test was applied to explore associations between psychological outcomes and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Linear regression models were used to investigate correlations between sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and average anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores. The researchers adhered to a signi cance level of 5% throughout the analysis. At T2, the univariate analysis similarly showed signi cant increases in anxiety (p = 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), and PTSD (p < 0.001) scores as age increased, with adolescents exhibiting greater (p = 0.006), depression (p = 0.001), and PTSD (p = 0.002) scores compared to children. Participants with a high risk of cancer had signi cantly higher anxiety (p = 0.007) and depression (p = 0.007) scores, while those aware of their diagnosis demonstrated signi cantly higher scores for anxiety (p = 0.007), depression (p = 0.003), and PTSD (p = 0.005). Increased anxiety scores correlated with increased depression (p < 0.001) and PTSD (p < 0.001) scores, while increased depression scores correlated with increased anxiety (p < 0.001) and PTSD (p < 0.001) scores. Finally, increased PTSD scores were associated with signi cant increases in both anxiety (p < 0.001) and depression (p < 0.001) scores [see Table 4].

        nif:anchorOf              "Cancer in childhood and adolescence ranked as the sixth leading contributor to the total global cancer burden in 2019 [1]. An estimated 429,000 individuals under 19 years of age are diagnosed with cancer every year, with 141-185 cases per million reported worldwide [2,3]. Approximately 100,000 children and adolescents die annually from cancer, with the vast majority of deaths (90%) occurring in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1]. Furthermore, those diagnosed with cancer in LMICs have a low ve-year survival rate of 30%, in stark contrast to high-income countries where survival rates exceed 80% due to signi cant advances in cancer treatment [2,3]. In Arab countries, over 18,000 children below the age of 15 years are diagnosed with cancer every year, with annual incidence rates ranging from 7.5 to 12.8 cases per 100,000 children, although variations may be due to differences in registration accuracy [4]. In Oman, approximately 31% of the total population is under 19 years of age [5]. In 2019, a total of 2,307 patients were diagnosed with cancer, of which 2,089 patients (91.5%) were of Omani nationality and 124 (5.9%) comprised children aged 0 to 14 years [6]. However, the anticipated total number of annual cancer diagnoses is projected to rise to 8,549 by the year 2040 [7]. Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are frequent in children and adolescents with cancer, with pooled prevalence rates of 13.92%, 20.43%, and 20.90%, respectively [8]. Recent research underscores a higher incidence of anxiety and depression in paediatric cancer patients and the heightened vulnerability of this demographic to post-traumatic stress symptoms, emphasising the need for a nuanced understanding of emotional challenges throughout the cancer diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and survivorship journey [9][10][11][12]. In itself, a diagnosis of cancer, along with accompanying physical symptoms and treatment side-effects, can lead to excessive tension, discomfort, and fear of death [8,13]. Symptoms of depression, including low mood, despair, guilt, and loss of interest in usual activities, may also challenge patients' ability to function and adhere to treatment [14]. As Oman continues to make signi cant improvements in healthcare delivery and medical treatment, cancer survival rates among children and adolescents have improved. However, the emotional toll of a cancer diagnosis cannot be underestimated, and an understanding of these psychological repercussions is crucial as an essential indicator of patients' well-being to ensure the provision of comprehensive oncologic care [8]. Our study therefore aimed to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer and their associated factors, and to describe changes occurring over time." ;

This child self-report instrument includes 41 items scored on a 3-point scale (from 0 to 2), yielding ve factors matching classi cations outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fth edition (DSM-IV) [16]. Overall, a total SCARED score of ≥ 25 may indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder, while scores of > 30 are more speci c to anxiety. According to a validation study, internal consistency (Cronbach's α) for the translated tool is 0.91, ranging between 0.65 and 0.89 for individual subscales [15]. Depressive symptoms were assessed using an Arabic version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) [17,18]. This self-report scale consists of 20 items scored on a 4-point scale (from 0 to 3), for a total score ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores more indicative of depression [17]. The cut-off CES-DC score is 15, with scores of 15-60 considered indicative of signi cant symptoms of depression. The Arabic version of the CES-DC has previously demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.90) [17]. An Arabic version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to measure symptoms of post-traumatic stress [19,20]. The IES-R is a self-report scale designed to assess current subjective distress for any major life event in children, adolescents, and adults, assessing the core symptom cluster of avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal [19,20]. The tool consists of 22 items scored on a 5-point scale (from 0 to 4), of which 14 items correspond directly to symptom criteria outlined in the DSM-IV. Total scores range from 0 to 88, with a cut-off IES-R score of 33 and above indicative of a probable diagnosis of PTSD [19,20]. According to previous research, the Arabic version of the self-report IES-R scale has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.94) [19]. Arabic versions of the SCARED, CES-DC, and IES-R instruments were administered twice to assess for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. The rst assessment (T1) was conducted at any time within the rst 3 months of diagnosis, while the second assessment (T2) was conducted 3 to 6 months after T1. Research assistants administered the questionnaire to participants aged 6 to 12 years, while the instruments were self-administered by participants aged 12 years or older. In both cases, a research assistant remained available to clarify any questions that the participants might have had during completion. Additional sociodemographic and clinical information was recorded by the researchers based on data gathered from the participants' medical records or elicited from the children's parents or primary caregivers at T1. Cancer risk was estimated based on the participant's age at diagnosis, disease stage, tumour histology, MYCN status (ampli ed versus nonampli ed), and tumour cell ploidy status [21]." ;

ResultsOf 113 eligible participants, 101 agreed to participate in the study (response rate: 95.6%), with 92 (91.0%) completing both assessments and included in the nal analysis. Prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD decreased from 43.5%, 56.5%, and 32.6%, respectively, at T1, to 38.0%, 35.9%, and 23.9% at T2. All average scores were below diagnostic cut-off points, except for the depression score at T1. Anxiety and depression scores decreased signi cantly (p = 0.043 and 0.001, respectively) between T1 and T2, as did the overall prevalence of depression (p = 0.004). At T1, linear regression analysis showed signi cant correlations between anxiety scores and the child's age and PTSD score (p < 0.05); these variables were also correlated with depression scores (p ≤ 0.001). At T2, signi cant correlations were observed between anxiety scores and the child's age and PTSD scores (p < 0.001).

Omani children and adolescents recently diagnosed with cancer exhibit a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD over time. Age-appropriate communication, ongoing support, and mental health services are recommended to help this patient group cope with their diagnosis and manage their emotional wellbeing. There is a need for future research to determine the effectiveness of speci c psychological interventions in reducing the frequency of these disorders. Cancer in childhood and adolescence ranked as the sixth leading contributor to the total global cancer burden in 2019 [1]. An estimated 429,000 individuals under 19 years of age are diagnosed with cancer every year, with 141-185 cases per million reported worldwide [2,3]. Approximately 100,000 children and adolescents die annually from cancer, with the vast majority of deaths (90%) occurring in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1]. Furthermore, those diagnosed with cancer in LMICs have a low ve-year survival rate of 30%, in stark contrast to high-income countries where survival rates exceed 80% due to signi cant advances in cancer treatment [2,3]. In Arab countries, over 18,000 children below the age of 15 years are diagnosed with cancer every year, with annual incidence rates ranging from 7.5 to 12.8 cases per 100,000 children, although variations may be due to differences in registration accuracy [4]. In Oman, approximately 31% of the total population is under 19 years of age [5]. In 2019, a total of 2,307 patients were diagnosed with cancer, of which 2,089 patients (91.5%) were of Omani nationality and 124 (5.9%) comprised children aged 0 to 14 years [6]. However, the anticipated total number of annual cancer diagnoses is projected to rise to 8,549 by the year 2040 [7]. Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are frequent in children and adolescents with cancer, with pooled prevalence rates of 13.92%, 20.43%, and 20.90%, respectively [8]. Recent research underscores a higher incidence of anxiety and depression in paediatric cancer patients and the heightened vulnerability of this demographic to post-traumatic stress symptoms, emphasising the need for a nuanced understanding of emotional challenges throughout the cancer diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and survivorship journey [9][10][11][12]. In itself, a diagnosis of cancer, along with accompanying physical symptoms and treatment side-effects, can lead to excessive tension, discomfort, and fear of death [8,13]. Symptoms of depression, including low mood, despair, guilt, and loss of interest in usual activities, may also challenge patients' ability to function and adhere to treatment [14]. As Oman continues to make signi cant improvements in healthcare delivery and medical treatment, cancer survival rates among children and adolescents have improved. However, the emotional toll of a cancer diagnosis cannot be underestimated, and an understanding of these psychological repercussions is crucial as an essential indicator of patients' well-being to ensure the provision of comprehensive oncologic care [8]. Our study therefore aimed to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer and their associated factors, and to describe changes occurring over time.  A cross-sectional study was conducted targeting all Omani children and adolescents aged six to 19 years diagnosed with any type of cancer between 1st October 2021 and 30th June 2023. The study was conducted at the National Oncology Centre (NOC) of the Royal Hospital, the Paediatric Haematology Unit of the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH), and the Sultan Qaboos Comprehensive Cancer Care and Research Centre (SQCCCRC). These centres, located in Muscat, the capital city of Oman, serve as the primary referral cancer centres providing integrated care for cancer patients throughout Oman. Participants were recruited during their visits to either the outpatient clinics of the three referral centres or upon admission to the oncology/haematology wards. Children and adolescents who were non-Omani or had cognitive and behavioural disorders (as documented in their medical records) were excluded from the study. An Arabic version of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) tool was used to screen for anxiety symptoms over the past three months [15,16]. This child self-report instrument includes 41 items scored on a 3-point scale (from 0 to 2), yielding ve factors matching classi cations outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fth edition (DSM-IV) [16]. Overall, a total SCARED score of ≥ 25 may indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder, while scores of > 30 are more speci c to anxiety. According to a validation study, internal consistency (Cronbach's α) for the translated tool is 0.91, ranging between 0.65 and 0.89 for individual subscales [15]. Depressive symptoms were assessed using an Arabic version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) [17,18]. This self-report scale consists of 20 items scored on a 4-point scale (from 0 to 3), for a total score ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores more indicative of depression [17]. The cut-off CES-DC score is 15, with scores of 15-60 considered indicative of signi cant symptoms of depression. The Arabic version of the CES-DC has previously demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.90) [17]. An Arabic version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to measure symptoms of post-traumatic stress [19,20]. The IES-R is a self-report scale designed to assess current subjective distress for any major life event in children, adolescents, and adults, assessing the core symptom cluster of avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal [19,20]. The tool consists of 22 items scored on a 5-point scale (from 0 to 4), of which 14 items correspond directly to symptom criteria outlined in the DSM-IV. Total scores range from 0 to 88, with a cut-off IES-R score of 33 and above indicative of a probable diagnosis of PTSD [19,20]. According to previous research, the Arabic version of the self-report IES-R scale has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.94) [19]. Arabic versions of the SCARED, CES-DC, and IES-R instruments were administered twice to assess for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. The rst assessment (T1) was conducted at any time within the rst 3 months of diagnosis, while the second assessment (T2) was conducted 3 to 6 months after T1. Research assistants administered the questionnaire to participants aged 6 to 12 years, while the instruments were self-administered by participants aged 12 years or older. In both cases, a research assistant remained available to clarify any questions that the participants might have had during completion. Additional sociodemographic and clinical information was recorded by the researchers based on data gathered from the participants' medical records or elicited from the children's parents or primary caregivers at T1. Cancer risk was estimated based on the participant's age at diagnosis, disease stage, tumour histology, MYCN status (ampli ed versus nonampli ed), and tumour cell ploidy status [21]. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics Software for Windows, version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics, including percentages, frequencies, means, and standard deviations, were used to delineate the participants' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as their average anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores. Paired t-tests and McNemar's tests were utilised to assess differences in average anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores between the two time points. Analysis of variance and independent sample t-tests were employed to assess variations between the dependent variable (average anxiety, depression, or PTSD scores) and independent variables (sociodemographic and clinical characteristics). Pearson's Chi-squared test was applied to explore associations between psychological outcomes and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Linear regression models were used to investigate correlations between sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and average anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores. The researchers adhered to a signi cance level of 5% throughout the analysis. At T2, the univariate analysis similarly showed signi cant increases in anxiety (p = 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), and PTSD (p < 0.001) scores as age increased, with adolescents exhibiting greater (p = 0.006), depression (p = 0.001), and PTSD (p = 0.002) scores compared to children. Participants with a high risk of cancer had signi cantly higher anxiety (p = 0.007) and depression (p = 0.007) scores, while those aware of their diagnosis demonstrated signi cantly higher scores for anxiety (p = 0.007), depression (p = 0.003), and PTSD (p = 0.005). Increased anxiety scores correlated with increased depression (p < 0.001) and PTSD (p < 0.001) scores, while increased depression scores correlated with increased anxiety (p < 0.001) and PTSD (p < 0.001) scores. Finally, increased PTSD scores were associated with signi cant increases in both anxiety (p < 0.001) and depression (p < 0.001) scores [see Table 4].  [15][16][17][18][19][20]. †Calculated using either analysis of variance or an independent sample t-test, as appropriate. ‡Using Pearson's correlation coe cient. ^Considered statistically signi cant at p ≤ 0.05. Estimated based on the participant's age at diagnosis, disease stage, tumour histology, MYCN status (ampli ed versus nonampli ed), and tumour cell ploidy status [21].  A linear regression analysis was conducted to establish links between anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores and various sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors. At T1, signi cant correlations were observed between anxiety scores and age (β = 0.762; p < 0.001), age group (adolescents vs. children; β = -0.217; p = 0.001), and PTSD scores (β = 0.209; p = 0.025), with an adjusted R 2 value of 0.861. Depression scores demonstrated signi cant correlations with age (β = 0.460; p = 0.001) and PTSD scores (β = 0.488; p < 0.001), with an adjusted R 2 value of 0.849. Finally, PTSD scores were signi cantly correlated with cancer risk (β = 0.147; p = 0.025), anxiety scores (β = 0.287; p = 0.016), and depression scores (β = 0.604; p < 0.001), with an adjusted R 2 value of 0.827 [see Table 5]. To our knowledge, this is the rst study conducted in Oman to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer, associated factors, and to describe changes occurring over time. Our ndings revealed that a high number of children and adolescents with cancer in Oman exhibit symptoms of anxiety (43.5%), depression (56.5%), and PTSD (32.6%) within the rst three months of diagnosis. Prevalence rates of these psychological disorders, especially anxiety and depression, were notably higher compared to the pooled rates reported in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of previous literature (13.92%, 20.43%, and 20.90%, respectively) [8]. However, these differences might be attributed to variations in the measurement and screening tools used across different studies. Alternatively, another explanation for the high prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms observed in our study could be linked to the lack of specialized or psychosocial supportive care for cancer patients in Oman, particularly at the time of diagnosis [22]. This is likely exacerbated by the fact that, in certain Arab cultures, including in Oman, there remains considerable stigma surrounding mental health issues, posing a challenge for individuals to actively seek or obtain psychological support [23,24]. Moreover, limitations in healthcare resources, such as a shortage of mental health professionals, may further hinder access to psychological support services for cancer patients [23]. Finally, a lack of widespread awareness regarding the signi cance of psychological support for cancer patients, particularly children and adolescents, could contribute to a shortage of available programs and services [25]. We also found that symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer decreased over time; these ndings are supported by other longitudinal studies [26][27][28]. Other research has shown that a healthy family environment is a strong protective factor against the development of these disorders, as well as improving the quality of life of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer [29,30]. In Oman, support extended by family members and friends to cancer patients has been observed to signi cantly reduce mental distress and alleviate the adverse side-effects associated with cancer treatment [22]. Moreover, cancer patients in Oman have been shown to develop various coping mechanisms and adaptive strategies to deal with the emotional impacts of a cancer diagnosis, including denial, optimism, withdrawal, and a strong reliance on Islamic beliefs and practices [31]. These factors likely play a role in decreasing psychological distress over time. The results of our study indicated that the child's age had a signi cant impact on their anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores, with adolescents exhibiting a higher likelihood of experiencing these conditions compared to children. Other studies have also highlighted a notable increase in major depressive episodes during the transition to adolescence [32,33]. This nding aligns with the understanding that adolescence is marked by hormonal changes and an enhanced ability to comprehend emotions [34]. Moreover, adolescents with cancer may face substantial disruptions to their education, potentially missing school due to the demands of treatment and recovery [35]. Repercussions may extend beyond academic skills, encompassing a range of missed opportunities, such as participation in sports, group activities, excursions, and award ceremonies, as well as the absence of daily structure and routine provided in the scholastic environment [36]. Prolonged absences from school and limited peer interaction can contribute to the development of emotional, behavioural, and psychological challenges [36,37]. We also found that children and adolescents who were informed of their diagnosis exhibited signi cantly higher anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores compared to those who remained unaware of their condition. The relationship between disclosure of a cancer diagnosis and mental health outcomes is complex, and individual reactions can vary widely. Some children and adolescents may bene t from being informed, as this allows them to be more actively involved in their own care and treatment decision-making, while others may nd comfort in not knowing the full extent of their illness [38]. Fundamentally, awareness of a cancer diagnosis results in a deeper cognitive understanding of illness severity, the side-effects of treatment, social stigma, and health uncertainties, all of which can increase anxiety and stress [39]. However, in Omani culture, it is routine for some parents and family members to try to protect their loved ones or keep their hopes up by choosing to withhold knowledge of their diagnosis [22]. Our ndings showed that high-risk patients had signi cantly higher PTSD scores during the rst three months of diagnosis. Patients with more aggressive types of cancer often require more intensive and invasive treatment regimens, such as surgery and radiation, resulting in long periods of hospitalization, all of which may contribute to increased stress, anxiety, and trauma [40]. Furthermore, the aggressive nature of the cancer and its associated treatment can create a sense of uncertainty about the future, including treatment outcomes and the potential for relapse [41]. Indeed, the physical and emotional toll of aggressive cancer can be overwhelming as a result of the sideeffects of treatment, including changes in physical appearance and disruptions to daily life, factors which can contribute to symptoms of depression [42]. The results of our study should be considered in the light of certain limitations. The study involved a prospective, crosssectional design in which Omani children and adolescents were screened for symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD at two separate time intervals following diagnosis. The length of time between these intervals might not have been adequate to track dynamic changes in anxiety and PTSD over time, thereby limiting our understanding of the longterm psychological effects of cancer diagnoses. An extended study period with more frequent assessments could have potentially enabled a more in-depth exploration of the psychological challenges faced by children and adolescents at different points in their cancer experiences. In addition, information regarding anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms was self-assessed by the participants; such self-reporting is susceptible to various biases, including memory recall in uenced by the passage of time, emotional states, and individual differences in cognitive processing. Thus, the participants may have unintentionally provided inaccurate or incomplete information regarding their psychological experiences, leading to potential discrepancies between reported and actual symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the rst study conducted in Oman to identify the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms, along with their associated factors, among Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer. The ndings indicated that children and adolescents in Oman exhibited high levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD within the rst three months of a cancer diagnosis. Implementing routine screening protocols for psychological symptoms among children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer, particularly within the rst three months of diagnosis, is imperative. The early identi cation of mental health challenges can facilitate timely intervention and support, particularly for adolescents, as they are more likely to suffer from psychological and emotional distress. The authors would like to thank the parents and guardians of the participants for allowing their children to take part in the study. The authors also extend their gratitude to the respective authorities of the NOC, SQUH, and SQCCCRC for permitting this study to be conducted." ;
