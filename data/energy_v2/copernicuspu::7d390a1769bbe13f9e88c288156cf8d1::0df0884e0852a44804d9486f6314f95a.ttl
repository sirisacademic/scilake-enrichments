Data from regional climate models for the European continent (EURO-CORDEX 11) were used. The use of climate model data requires first an inspection of the data and a correction of the biases of the meteorological model. Both the correction of biases of the point precipitation and those of the spatial structure were performed. For this purpose, a quantilequantile transformation of the point precipitation and a spatial recorrelation method were used. Once bias-corrected, the data from the regional climate model were downscaled to a finer spatial scale using a stochastic method with equally probable outcomes. This enables the assessment of the corresponding uncertainties. The downscaled fields were used to derive areadepth-duration-frequency (ADDF) curves, and area-reduction-factors (ARF) for selected regions in Germany. The estimated curves were compared to those derived from a reference weather radar data set. While the corrected and downscaled data show good agreement with the observed reference data over all temporal and spatial scales, the future climate simulations indicate an increase in the estimated areal rainfall depth for future periods. Moreover, the future ARFs for short durations and large spatial scales increase compared to the reference value, while for longer durations the difference is smaller. Climate change became a very important issue in the past decades. It is likely to affect life conditions all over the world. One of the important issues in this context is how magnitudes and frequencies of extremes will change. A large number of studies were conducted to investigate this issue. In general, global climate models (GCMs) are used to model the past changes (forced by observations) in climate systems on a global scale and to project future changes (forced by emissions scenarios) (Randall et al., 2007). These are based on the numerical solution of mathematical representations of the physical processes and their interactions (such as the conservation of energy, mass, and momentum, the thermodynamic equations such as the gas law, and the connection of processes on land with the atmosphere and vice-versa) (Randall et al., 2007;Hennemuth et al., 2017). GCM provides output variables with a relatively coarse space-time resolution, typically between 100 and 500 km 2 , and for 6-hour intervals (Stocker, 2014). However, the transfer and use of global results to local and regional climate analysis, especially for hydrological processes such as precipitation, requires a finer space-time resolution, which can be achieved https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-288 Preprint.

(2017) derived future IDF curves for South Korea from daily RCM data through stochastic downscaling to sub-daily resolutions incorporated into a Bayesian inference framework. The results indicate an increase in the expected rainfall from 5 to 30% under the RCP8.5 scenario. Other works also exist, for example, Hosseinzadehtalaei et al. (2018) derived future IDF for Belgium, Forestieri et al. (2018) for Sicily in Italy and for Iran (Khazaei, 2021). Many of the previous studies consider deriving the DDF (or IDF) for the point scale. Traditionally area reduction factors (ARF) are used to transfer the point value to the areal (or catchment) scale. These are in general based on simple assumptions, and the effect of climate change is not considered. However, the consequences of heavy precipitation, such as flooding, are related to the volume of water, so the spatial aspect should not be ignored. This work considers precipitation as a spatial phenomenon, without purely point statistics, and aims to assess the expected change in future areal precipitation extremes under the RCP8.5 scenario compared to reference data and the present period. This is done by calculating area-depth-durationfrequency curves (ADDF) over several durations (hourly to daily) and over different spatial scales from 1 to 1000 km 2 . Essential questions to be investigated in this work are: 1. Knowing that precipitation extremes look different depending on scales, to what extent can the climate model produce extremes correctly? 2. How can spatial and temporal dependence structures of climate models be successfully corrected? To answer these questions, the following scheme was undertaken. The first step consisted of upscaling the point data to the model scale. This enabled deriving a reference for temporal and spatial dependence structures. A recorrelation procedure was implemented to correct the model spatial dependence structure to match the reference. In the second step, the bias in the magnitudes of future projections and any subsequent bias in the marginal distribution function was corrected using a double-QQ transformation. The corrected data on the model scale were then spatially downscaled using a conditional simulation method (Bárdossy and Hörning, 2016b, a). From the downscaled spatial fields, areal precipitation statistics were derived and compared to those extracted from weather radar data. The downscaling and analysis of areal precipitation extremes are showcased in the third section of this manuscript. The results are discussed and a conclusion involving key messages finalizes the paper. The study area is delimited by the weather radar region of Hannover located in the state of Lower Saxony in Germany. The weather radar is positioned at the Hannover airport and has a coverage radius of 128 km. The north of the region is generally flat, and moving towards the southeast the elevation increases to 1141 m a.s.l. in the Harz Mountains. The average yearly precipitation ranges from 500 to 1700 mm yr 1 (Haberlandt and Berndt, 2016b). Following previous studies on the space-time statistics of rainfall extremes, the latter was selected as the study area (El Hachem et al., 2022;Goshtsasbpour et al., 2022). https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-288 Preprint. Discussion started: 16 January 2024 c Author(s) 2024. CC BY 4.0 License. Within this region, the German Weather Service (DWD) operates a precipitation measurement network of 127 rain gauges with sub-hourly resolution (DWD Climate Data Center (CDC), 2021a). The data for these stations were acquired for the years between 2005 and 2020. Moreover, the hourly weather radar data (RADOLAN-RW) for the period 2005-2020 were used. The latter is the operational DWD radar composite. It is a merged product of the derived precipitation fields from all available weather radars and the DWD rain gauges. The data were made available by the DWD (DWD Climate Data Center (CDC), 2021b). For this study, only the observations lying within the radar area of Hannover were extracted. The third data set is the EURO-CORDEX data. These have been provided within the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) for the European continent with two horizontal simulation domains of 50 km (EUR-44) and 12.5 km (EUR-11). The simulation output consists of several data sets with hourly resolution representing different atmospheric and surface-near variables such as precipitation (Jacob et al., 2014). The REgional MOdel (REMO) is especially advantageous for precipitation analysis on the hourly scale since advection is integrated within the parameterization scheme (Jacob and Podzun, 1997;Jacob, 2001). In this work, the MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR-GERICS-REMO2015-v1 developed by the Max-Planck-Institute für Meteorologie (MPI-M) and the Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS) was used. The data were made available by the ClimXtreme Central Evaluation System framework (Kadow et al., 2021). The goal is to find the reliability/usability of the RCM model data for areal precipitation analysis with a special focus on extremes. Since the model data consist of grid cell averages, it is not suitable to compare them to rain gauge (point) data. Hence, the first reference data was based on interpolated fields using the DWD station data (refered to as DWD point ). The interpolation was carried out using Ordinary Kriging and the weather radar observation grid of 1 km was used as the interpolation grid. The resulting fields were then spatially aggregated to match the EURO-CORDEX 11 • grid. This reference data set will be denoted hereafter as DWD interp . The second data set is the spatially averaged radar data for the period 2005-2020. The aggregated 150 data match the model grid and are denoted hereafter as Radar avg . Note that in all cases the arithmetic mean of the 1 km pixels falling within each model cell was calculated and assigned to the corresponding model pixel. A summary of the used data sets is presented in Table 1. The procedure for analyzing, correcting, and downscaling the RCM data is divided into three parts and is presented in Figure 2. First, the spatial dependence structure of the model needs to be corrected according to a reference-based structure. The correction of the distribution of the point precipitation amounts is done subsequently. In order that the biased precipitation amount distribution should not influence the spatial structure, it was derived on the basis of the pixel-wise rank correlation using a reference data set (for example, DWD interp ). The correction is based on a recorrelation procedure described in section 3.1. The dependence structure affects greatly the areal extremes, especially for large spatial events (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2012). This part refers to section (a) of the flowchart in Figure 2. Once the dependence structure has been corrected, any remaining bias in the marginal distribution function of future climate projections has to be handled. For this, a double-QQ transformation involving information from the reference data and the model historical data was applied (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2011). This section represents part (b) of the flowchart in Figure 2. Afterwards, the final corrected data are downscaled using a stochastic simulation algorithm (random mixing, (Bárdossy and Hörning, 2016b)) to the finer spatial resolution of 1 km. The final fields are eventually used for the analysis of the spatial extent of extremes via area-depth-duration-frequency (ADDF) curves. The ADDF curves were calculated on the pixel-scale (1 km 2 area), for different areas (up to 1024 km 2 ) and durations (hourly to daily). The possible impact of climate change on the statistics of areal extremes was to be investigated. Note that this section refers to part (c) of the flowchart in Figure 2 The spatial dependence of precipitation plays a major role in the distribution of areal rainfall and the corresponding extremes. An often neglected problem is whether regional climate models can replicate the observed dependence structure. In (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2012) this problem was discussed and a possible solution was presented. A similar procedure was here implemented, however, using a finer spatial and temporal resolution and instead of the Pearson correlation a rank correlation type method was used with normal score transformed variables. To account for different precipitation mechanisms and characteristics, the reference and model data were divided between the summer (April-September) and winter (October-March) seasons, and for each period the dependence structure was derived. A special challenge while working with sub-daily and especially hourly precipitation data is the large number of 0 mm precipitation values (around 80%). DWD interp data (red dots). The DWD point correlation values are lower than those of the DWD interp data. This difference can be justified theoretically -assuming stationarity of the spatial dependence -as the interblock variability leads to the reduction of the variance. In fact, the covariance between two grid cells V i and V j can be written as a function of the covariance function of the point values C(x, y): While for the variance of the grid cell V : Both the covariance and the variance decrease. The decrease of the covariance is less than or equal to that of the variance, thus the correlation increases. Thus due to scale difference, using the DWD point correlation structure as a reference for the correction of the EURO-CORDEX spatial structure would be incorrect. In  The procedure presented by Bárdossy and Pegram (2012) used a mixed-type distribution, defined by a censored Gaussian copula to transform the daily precipitation data to the normal space, and a matrix recorrelation procedure based on linear algebra was implemented. The aim was to recorrelate the model data to obtain the same reference dependence structure. The latter was derived by calculating the Pearson correlation between the daily precipitation time series at the different grid cell locations. A similar procedure was implemented in this section, however, using the theoretical correlation of the normal score transformed data. A normal score transformation cannot be performed directly due to the large portion of zero values. Thus, instead, indicator series were used. The indicator series I(t, u) were calculated for the reference and model data given a probability level α. Several threshold values were tested, and the value α = 0.9 was selected as it provided the best recorrelation results. Let F (t, u) be the distribution function of the precipitation time series Z at location u. The indicator series can be calculated using equation 3. After converting the reference and model data to indicator series (0 and 1), the pair-wise correlation between two indicator series ρ i (u, v) was calculated. The indicator correlation matrix for the reference data is defined by R i and for the model data by M i . For a given probability value α, there is a one to one relationship between the indicator correlation corresponding to two locations u and v (ρ i (u, v)) and the correlation of a bivariate Gaussian variable (ρ g (u, v)) which has the same indicator correlation.  Here y α corresponds to the α probability standard normal distribution function The estimation of ρ g (u, v) has to be carried out numerically. Using the relation in equation 4, both indicator correlation matrices (describing the correlation between the grid points) of the reference and model data R i and M i were transformed to Gaussian correlation matrices R g and M g . To ensure that the correlation matrices for the grids, R g and M g , are positive semidefinite, minor modifications to the correlation values were undertaken while minimizing the distance between the original matrices (R g and M g ) and the modified matrices (R * g and M * g ) (Bárdossy and Plate, 1992). From this point on, the matrix R * g was transformed to the matrix S g by calculating the square root of applying single value decomposition (SVD) to R * g . Afterward, the correlation matrix M * g was transformed to T g by calculating the inverse square root of applying SVD to M * g . The recorrelation matrix F = T g S g was used to recorrelate M * g to R * g by matrix multiplication The values in V g are in the Gaussian space and can be back-transformed to indicator correlations using a QQ transformation. Eventually, the model precipitation data were recorrelated using the recorrelation matrix F . Any negative values after recorrelation were set to 0 precipitation value. The flowchart in Figure 4 gives an overview of the recorrelation steps. The recorrelation matrix F derived from the historical observations for each season separately can be used to recorrelate projected RCP scenarios. This is possible since the model's historical and future dependence structures are highly similar (see Figure A1). In Figure 6, the correlation values of the recorrelated grid cells are calculated as a function of the separating distance. Similar to Figure 3  The recorrealtion procedure was done for every duration (from hourly to daily) separately. This provided consistent results for all durations. Note that this complete part refers to section (a) of the flowchart in Figure 2. After correcting the dependence structure, the marginal distribution function of the model's future data were corrected using a double QQ transformation. In statistics, quantile-quantile plots (QQ plots) are used to compare two distributions and identify if they both belong to the same distribution function. Often a test distribution is compared to a theoretical one. The comparison is based on the quantiles. Namely, a scatter plot between the quantiles of both data values is constructed. If the data have the same distribution function, the QQ plot will be defined by a linear function (y=x). To derive the QQ plot, the data of the two distribution functions are sorted, and their quantiles are calculated. In this section, a QQ mapping was applied to correct the bias in the projected model data while preserving the ranks of the values. An example of this was shown by Bárdossy and Pegram (2011) where the distribution function of regional climate models (RCM) was corrected using a double QQ transformation as defined by equation 5. For this, the CDF of the upscaled reference data at location X (for example DWD interp ) and the CDF of the recorrelated model data for the historical and future periods for the same location X were used. For the observation and historical data, a Weibull distribution function with three parameters was fitted using the maximum likelihood method (Singh, 1987). The latter was chosen as it provided the best fit. Bárdossy, 2019). The extrapolation using the exponential distribution is defined by equation 6. Let (Z m , U m ) define the pair of the largest precipitation observation and corresponding quantile, the parameter λ is calculated following equation 7. This enables correcting the RCP future data while allowing for maximum values to exceed the current observed values. In panel (a) of Figure 7 the x-axis refers to precipitation in millimeters and the y-axis to the cumulative probabilities. The red curve is the distribution function of the reference data DWD interp . The green curve is the RCM distribution for the historical period and the blue curve shows the RCM curve for a future scenario. For every precipitation value in the future data, the corresponding value in the historical data is found and for that, the corresponding value for the same quantile level in the observations data is assigned as the future value. An example of this is presented in Figure 7. In panel (a), the blue curve refers to the EURO-CORDEX historical data after the recorrelation procedure, the green curve to the recorrelated RCP8.5 data, and the red curve to the reference data DWD interp for the observation period. The black curve shows the double-QQ corrected RCP8.5 distribution function using the previously described procedure. Panel (b) displays a scatter plot of the values after recorrelation (gray dots) and after the recorrelation and double-QQ mapping (blue dots). The red line refers to the raw RCP8.5 data. Panel (c) displays the CDF of DWD interp , Radar avg , the EURO-CORDEX historical, and the RCP8.5 data before and after correction for the same grid cell location. The Radar avg indicate a smaller maximum value compared to DWD interp , though both distributions show few differences. Similarly to the recorrelation procedure, the double-QQ correction was done for every duration separately. Note that this section refers to part (b) in the flowchart in Figure 2. This double-QQ transformation reduces the bias in the model data while preserving the signal in the RCP data (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2011). The final recorrelated and double-QQ corrected data are used for downscaling and investigating the areal rainfall statistics. To estimate rainfall depth for design values, a statistical analysis of rainfall maxima derived from long records is required. In general, design values are associated with the corresponding duration and return period. The previous concept forms the basis of statistical analysis of heavy rainfall. Rainfall maxima are extracted from the observation time series for the different durations either by considering the yearly maxima (annual series) or the values exceeding a minimal threshold (partial series). The relation between rainfall depth, duration, and return period is commonly known as the Depth-Duration-Frequency (DDF) or Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve. The idea behind the DDF curve is to derive a mathematical expression relating the average rainfall intensity (i) occurring over a timescale (d) for a predefined return period (T) (Koutsoyiannis and Papalexiou, 2017). DDF curves are used to estimate the probability of non-exceedance of a certain rainfall amount for a given duration. These can be derived by a frequency analysis of the observed station data for different durations. Standard practice is to fit to the empirically calculated DDF curve a theoretical extreme value distribution function (e.g., Gumbel Type I), from which one can derive the possible rainfall depth (or intensity) for a certain return period and timescale. The reasoning behind fitting a distribution function to the sampled annual or partial maxima is that these represent only one realization of the possible rainfall values for the corresponding duration. In this work, the ADDF curves were derived from the observed annual series of 15 years (2005-2020), following the procedure described by the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste in DWA-A 532 (DWA-A, 2012). The extreme value distribution type I, known also as the Gumbel distribution function, is applied in the following form: Where: T n = return period of the annual maxima in years [a] u j , w j = parameters of the distribution function For precipitation volumes, the consideration of the areal mean is required. The calculation of the Area-DDF (ADDF) curves is not straightforward, as in contrast to point precipitation areal precipitation is not measured but has to be estimated. Further, the distribution of the areal precipitation amounts differs from the distribution of point values. For example, using the weather radar data for a target location of an area of 1000 km 2 , all pixels located within the area are identified, and for every time step the average of all the pixels is calculated. Eventually, a time series is acquired and used as input to the DDF calculation procedure. Bennett et al. (2016) first suggested the use of interpolated rainfall data for the direct estimation of the statistics of areal extremes by introducing the intensity-duration-frequency-area curves. The need for ARF to convert points to spatial rainfall would be then eliminated. Radar-derived precipitation data can be used to calculate the ADDF curves. However, the quality of the radar reference data and the relatively short observation time period highly influence the results (Haberlandt and Berndt, 2016a). Marra and Morin (2015) used radar QPE to derive IDF curves for the region of Israel and compared the results to nearby rain gauges. Despite efforts to reduce errors in the radar QPE, the final results showed an overestimation of radar-derived IDF curves. An effect that increased with larger durations. Another study done by Ghebreyesus and Sharif (2021) using the radar QPE data over the state of Texas to derive state-wide IDF curves showed mostly an underestimation of short-duration maxima. The goal of using the radar QPE data is to be able to derive spatially and temporally reliable IDF curves, eliminating the need for area reduction factors (Ghebreyesus and Sharif, 2021). Areal precipitation extremes derived from weather radar data are prone to errors (Schleiss et al., 2020). For instance, due to attenuation, beam blockage, sub-scale variability, and simplified Z-R relation (Villarini and Krajewski, 2010). However, as there is still no possibility to correctly measure areal extremes, the error term cannot be easily quantified. In addition, the rain gauge observations are sparse. Many short-duration intense rainfall events cannot be correctly sampled, and many are completely missed (Lengfeld et al., 2020). The high spatial and temporal availability of the RADOLAN-RW merged stationradar data makes it advantageous for the analysis of areal extremes and was used in this study for the estimation of reference ADDF curves (DWD Climate Data Center (CDC), 2021b). However, due to the limited available temporal period, the ADDF curves were derived for return periods of 5 years. Such short return periods are relevant for the design of urban drainage networks. In order to better assess the quality of the EURO-CORDEX model data when representing areal precipitation extremes, a direct comparison between point observations and model values is not reliable due to scale differences. Therefore, a spatial downscaling of the model grid cell values to a finer scale is required. A deterministic approach, such as an interpolation https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-288 Preprint. Discussion started: 16 January 2024 c Author(s) 2024. CC BY 4.0 License. technique, can only provide one possible subscale realization without any estimate of an uncertainty interval. In general, most interpolation techniques can only provide smoothed fields because, in all Kriging applications, the equation system is solved by minimizing the estimation variance. Hence, the interpolated fields have less variability than the original one. However, for hydrological applications, many processes are driven by variability rather than the average values. To this end, a simulation of many possible realistic realizations with the same dependence structure can offer the corresponding variability. In general, there are two main types of simulation methods: conditional and unconditional simulations. Random mixing is a conditional simulation method that allows the stochastic generation of realizations that satisfy multiple conditions (Bárdossy and Hörning, 2016b). The method is extended from the work of Hu (2000) regarding the gradual deformation of Gaussian fields. In order to achieve the goal of having realistic realizations, the following criteria must be fulfilled by the simulated field: 1. Match the measured data (conditioned on observations). 2. Have the same spatial dependence structure (represented by a variogram or spatial copula function). The random mixing methods allow capturing the spatial dependence structure through a spatial copula function. A copula is a mathematical function used to derive and model the dependence between variables independently of their distribution functions. If a spatial copula function was used, the asymmetry of the spatial field could be better taken into account (asymmetry can be viewed as the measure of skewness of univariate data). Another advantage of random mixing is the possibility to include multiple conditional observations that can be integrated as linear (equality) or non-linear (inequality) constraints. As a stochastic method, several equally possible realistic realizations of a certain event (or time step) can be derived along the associated mean uncertainty field. In this work, random mixing was used to upscale and downscale the DWD point observations to the EURO-CORDEX scale and vice-versa. The RMWSPy Python package was used to that end (Hörning and Haese, 2021). First, based on the DWD point data for the period 2005-2020, conditional fields were simulated for every time step with precipitation > 1 mm. The simulated fields were conditioned on the DWD point observations, the corresponding marginal distribution function, and the fitted covariance (or variogram) model representing the spatial dependence structure. In this step, the calculated experimental variogram was normed and saved. Note that because the variogram was calculated in the rank space, its estimation was smoother than by using the original observations. Eventually, a K-mean clustering was applied and three clusters of variograms were identified (Hartigan and Wong, 1979). Different numbers of clusters were tested, but the chosen number of clusters (3) was found to be the most suitable as the fitted models were the most distinct. For each cluster, the mean variogram was calculated and an exponential variogram without a nugget was fitted. Since the EURO-CORDEX data are on the grid cell scale, the estimated spatial model is smoother than that of the point scale. Hence, for downscaling, the spatial dependence model calculated from the grid cell values needed to be rescaled to the point scale. To that end, using the EURO-CORDEX data the experimental variograms were calculated, and a similar clustering approach was https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-288 Preprint. Discussion started: 16 January 2024 c Author(s) 2024. CC BY 4.0 License. applied. This allowed assigning for every time step (for every duration) a suitable variogram. A similar approach of variogram clustering was presented in Bárdossy et al. (2021). Figure 8 shows the fitted exponential variograms to each average cluster variogram from the point and model data. The grid cell variograms show similar behaviour as those derived from the point scale but with a smaller variance and a larger range. In other terms, for the same separating distance, the variance of the grid cell model is smaller than that of the point model. For each time step in the RCP8.5 data, the corresponding variogram cluster was identified and the corresponding point scale variogram was used to rescale the spatial model. Without rescaling the grid cell variogram to the point variogram, the downscaled fields would be much smoother than the actual 1 km fields. After correcting the spatial dependence structure and the bias in the CDF of the future RCP data, conditional realizations (conditioned on the model areal averages) at a finer spatial scale of 1 km (the weather radar grid) were generated using random mixing. Hence, the downscaling part. Note that this section corresponds to part (c) in the flowchart shown in Figure 2. This process incorporates the climate signal from the projections and provides a dataset that can be used to derive future ADDF curves for the study area. To account for the uncertainty acquired by the simulation approach, 50 downscaled and equally probable time series for every pixel in the simulation domain were generated. The step-by-step procedure to downscale the EURO-CORDEX RCP8.5 data for the period 2005-2099 for a given Area-DDF location using random mixing is described below: 1. Create a buffer enclosing the ADDF largest area (1024 km 2 ). 2. Find all EURO-CORDEX grid cells falling within the buffer (conditional values). 3. Find all radar pixels falling within the buffer (simulation domain For every hour in the projected RCP8.5 data with precipitation > 1 mm, read corrected values. 5. Fit a non-parametric marginal distribution using Kernel density estimate with Gaussian kernel. 6. Derive the CDF and its inverse (invcdf ) by optimizing the kernel width. 7. Transform the observations to standard normal space using the fitted CDF. 8. Fit an exponential covariance model. 9. Scale the model to match the reference point model. 10. Run conditional simulations (50 simulations) 11. Back-transform to original data space using invcdf . 12. Repeat for the next time steps. An example of the simulation domain for one ADDF location is shown in panel (a) of Figure 9. The domain shown in red has a total area of 1024 km 2 . Within this domain, the areas of 1, 16, 36, 100, 256, 576, and 1024 km 2 were considered for deriving the ADDF curves. These are derived as DDF curves but by using a time series of the average of all pixels within each area. For example, for the area size of 1024 km 2 , for every time step the average of the pixels enclosed by this area (pixels in red) was calculated. Using the same procedure for DDF curves (described in section 3.3), the ADDF curve for this area was derived. In panel (a), the gray pixels represent the complete simulation domain and the blue dots are the center of the EURO-CORDEX grid cells. The precipitation values at these grid cells were used as equality constraints in the downscaling part. To showcase the influence of the variogram scaling procedure, two different spatial dependence models were used, model M2 (derived from EURO-CORDEX data) and model P2 (derived from DWD point ). Both can be seen in panel (b) of Figure 8. Because the simulations using random mixing are stochastic, it is difficult to compare them, hence, for comparison purposes, the average of 50 simulations was considered. Therefore, 50 realizations were generated using both models and the average fields were compared. Panels (b) and (c) in Figure 9 display the average fields using model M2 and model P2, respectively. Note that the main difference in the spatial models is their range and how they approach the asymptotic limit. In panel (b), the larger range in model M2 is reflected by larger connected high (or low) rainfall grid cells and less variability in the final field, noted by the transition between wet (or high) and dry (or low) rainfall areas. The field in panel (c) based on model P2 has more variability and the smaller range is reflected by more discontinuities between the high and low values. Note that both average fields were conditioned on the same recorrelated and double-QQ corrected RCP8.5 data. Hence, to account for this difference in the sub-scale downscaled fields, the grid cell variograms needed to be rescaled to the point scale. The downscaled fields are used to calculate the ADDF for selected regions/pixels in the study area. The aim is to derive areal extremes for future periods, particularly from the RCP8.5 data. The realizations generated by the conditional simulations are all equally probable but limited to spatial constraints and not temporally correlated (e.g., advection is not included). Therefore, for each time step with precipitation> 1 mm, 50 simulations were generated across the simulation domain for each duration separately. This was essential, otherwise, the fields would not be space-time continuous. For example, on the hourly scale, each realization for each time step will most likely be different from the realization of the next time step, despite being equally probable and statistically correct. Aggregating these fields will lead to an incorrect representation of the areal rainfall. A simple but computationally intensive solution was to aggregate the hourly corrected data for each required duration and rerun the simulations again. A different possible solution would have been to use the generated fields for time step i as unconditional fields (instead of random fields) for time step i+1. This would have required modifying the simulation algorithm to include time as a third dimension. However, since the focus is on areal statistics, especially annual maxima, and not on event reconstruction, the first solution was seen as adequate enough for this scope. Moreover, an alternative stochastic simulation approach could have been tested. For example, Papalexiou et al. (2021) and Bárdossy and Hörning (2023) present frameworks for simulating space-time rainfall fields with characteristics such as velocity field, advection, anisotropy, and a flexible dependence structure. After the simulations were completed, the ADDF curves for the area size of 1 km 2 were calculated from the generated time series for four different time periods, 2005-2025, 2026-2045, 2046-2064, and 2065-2099. For comparison . For comparison  Compared to the RADOLAN data, the raw RCP8.5 values for both periods show an overestimation of the maxima over all durations. The final corrected values (green boxes), however, fall within the range of the RADOLAN data and show a good agreement for the period 2005-2025. Additionally, the boxplots of the raw data indicate a larger range compared to the corrected data. For example, the estimated rainfall depth from raw data for the duration of 720 min (12 hours) varies between 40 and 100 mm with a mean value of 60 mm. However, in the corrected data, the range is between 25 and 40 mm. This indicates that the raw data has greater spread and variability, which makes it difficult to use a trustworthy uncertainty interval. Using the double-QQ correction alone improved the results compared to the RCP8.5 raw data but was still far from the RADOLAN data. This also indicates the need for correction of the spatial dependence structure. In all data sets, an increase in the expected rainfall depth from the first to the second period is clearly visible. Though with different magnitudes. Panel (b) of Figure 10 shows the ADDF for the period 2065-2099 and indicates an increase in the expected rainfall depth for all durations and a return period of 5 years. However, the increase is not homogeneous across all durations and varies accordingly. From the downscaled fields, the ADDF curves were derived from the raw, the double-QQ, and the recorrelated and double-QQ  Looking at the variation in the estimated rainfall depth across the different spatial scales (the ADDF areas), the latter was found to be dependent on the duration. For example, the change between the ADDF values of the small areas (1 or 16 km 2 ) compared to the larger scale (576 or 1024 km 2 ) is different on the hourly scale than on the 6-hour scale (for example). The change between spatial scales decreases with increasing duration. Namely, a larger area reacts similarly to a smaller one for long durations. To illustrate this, the 1 hour and 6 hours duration were chosen as an example. For the hourly scale, the difference between the average estimated rainfall depth for the small area of 16 km 2 and the largest area of 1024 km 2 is around 25%  In Table 2, the average percentage of increase in the expected rainfall depth between the two time periods and for the different durations and area sizes is shown. The percentage was calculated as the ratio between the mean estimated rainfall depth for the two time periods 2005-2025 and 2065-2099 for the corresponding area size and duration. The results in Table 2 indicate that the impact of climate change on the different spatial scales is duration dependent. For instance, on the hourly scale, the percentage of increase is bigger for the larger areas than for the smaller areas, namely 15% for the area size of 1024 km 2 and 11% for the area size of 1 km 2 . This difference is minimal for durations longer than 8 hours. For instance, on the 18-hour duration, all area sizes have a similar percentage of increase (≈ 23%). On the other hand, the percentage of increase changes with the duration for a fixed area size. For example, for the area size of 100 km 2 , the increase for the hourly duration is 12% while for the daily duration, it is 28%. One would expect a monotonic increase with the area size and duration. This is mostly the case, except for some area sizes and duration (for example, for the duration of 6 hours, the area size of 256 km 2 shows a The final results indicate that the proposed methodology succeeded in obtaining reliable areal extremes from regional climate models over several durations and spatial scales. Using the RCP8.5 data from the model without any correction showed an overestimation of the derived ADDF curves across all temporal durations and considered periods. The overestimation was evident in comparison to the values derived from RADOLAN-RW for the period 2005-2020. The double-QQ method corrected the bias in the marginal distribution function but was not sufficient to achieve values in the range of the RADOLAN-RW data. The recorrelation procedure, namely the correction of the spatial dependence structure, was needed. To handle the large number of 0 mm values, the recorrelation had to be applied to the Gaussian transformed indicator correlation time series. This not only improved the pair-wise Pearson correlation but also the rank correlation (Spearman correlation). Eventually, the combination of the recorrelation method and the double-QQ transformation was needed. In fact, since the recorrelation procedure is based on indicator correlations, applying it before or after the double-QQ mapping makes no difference. The indicator correlation is not sensitive to quantile mapping. For downscaling to the finer spatial scale, the corrected data were used as conditional values within a stochastic downscaling algorithm. This gave an uncertainty interval for each ADDF curve. However, as part of the downscaling, the spatial dependence model needed to be rescaled to achieve larger small-scale variability. The final derived ADDF curves were in the same range as the RADOLAN values for the period 2005-2020. The procedure used consisted of many steps, but was necessary to obtain reliable results. After the correction and downscaling, the signal in the RCP projections was not lost, the increase in areal precipitation values between the first period (2005-2025) and the last period (2065-2099) was noted before and after the correction. However, the magnitude of this increase was smaller in the corrected data. values were calculated from the ADDF curves and, after correction, showed a better agreement with the reference values. They show an increase in the values between the two time periods, especially for short durations. This refers to a change in the relationship between small and large-scale precipitation events. The increase in the expected rainfall depth was obtained for small and large spatial scales (1 to 1024 km 2 ) and for short and long durations. However, this increase was not constant but proportional to the increase in area size and duration. For shorter durations, the percentage of increase varied between 10 and 20%. For longer durations (above 8 hours) between 20 and 30%. The results are consistent with other studies that examined the influence of climate change on precipitation extremes. However, the results in this work provide insight into possible future values for areal extremes at various spatial scales (and not just the point scale). Furthermore, the effect of the duration was stronger than the effect of area size. If the area size is constant, the percentage of increase with the duration is greater than if the duration is constant, and the area size increases. The largest increase occurs for the daily duration and largest area size. The analysis of future areal extremes is essential for adaptation strategies. For practical purposes such as the design of urban drainage systems, rainfall depth values associated with relatively short return periods of 5 years are required. Moreover, the uncertainty interval obtained from the downscaling scheme provides an ensemble of values needed for risk analysis. The ADDF curves were derived using the DWA-A 532 procedure with the Gumbel distribution. However, there are alternative ways to calculate the DDF curves. For instance, Koutsoyiannis et al. (1998) and Fischer and Schumann (2018) offer alternative frameworks. Subsequent derived ADDF values will change, and the corresponding results may as well. Furthermore, the results shown in this work are only valid for relatively small areas (mesoscale catchment size) of up to 1000 km 2 . For larger areas, the areal mean precipitation is less of interest, while the areal distribution becomes more relevant. The correlation structure was assumed to be homogeneous and not changing with time. In other terms, the spatial dependence structure is assumed to not be influenced by climate change. An aspect that is already present in the raw EURO-CORDEX data (see Figure A1). This assumption may not be valid. However, the presented approach using the indicator correlation is more robust, although it assumes a multi-normal dependence structure. Which may not always be valid. The final results show close agreement with the reference RADOLAN values, although the latter may underestimate the areal extremes. Investigating the changes in the statistical properties of climatic variables, such as rainfall due to a changing climate, is essential for coping and preparing for future periods. Regional climate models provide useful information about climatic data for historical and future scenarios. These have been generated based on increasing emission levels, hence, changing the physical, energetic, and thermodynamic balance between the atmospheric components. The outcome of RCM data is in general too coarse for local analysis and often spatial or/and temporal downscaling is applied. The final results show realistic ADDF curves and ARF values that can be used for impact analysis. Main messages behind this manuscript: 1. Using regional climate model data directly leads to an overestimation of the areal extremes. 2. Correcting the spatial dependence structure and the magnitudes of the data improves the usability of the data. 3. Spatial downscaling using random mixing is possible and offers uncertainty intervals. 4. The signal in the RCP is not lost and is present in the future areal extremes. 5. The corrected data of the RCP8.5 scenario indicate an increase in the rainfall depth over all temporal and spatial scales. The study could be further extended and applied to several GCM-RCM products. This will provide an ensemble of possible uncertainty scenarios for future projections of DDF and ADDF curves. Although the procedure would be similar for the different GMC-RCM combinations, the results might differ. The procedure could be also further evaluated for other geographical locations. Moreover, instead of working with ADDF areas, a selected catchment could have been used. The resulting future areal precipitation extremes could be integrated into a hydrological model to assess the impact on the discharge values. Table A1 shows the estimated parameters of the three theoretical exponential variogram models. These were fitted to the average empirical variogram of every cluster (shown in Figure . 8) using the DWD point and the EURO-CORDEX data." ;

Data from regional climate models for the European continent (EURO-CORDEX 11) were used. The use of climate model data requires first an inspection of the data and a correction of the biases of the meteorological model. Both the correction of biases of the point precipitation and those of the spatial structure were performed. For this purpose, a quantilequantile transformation of the point precipitation and a spatial recorrelation method were used. Once bias-corrected, the data from the regional climate model were downscaled to a finer spatial scale using a stochastic method with equally probable outcomes. This enables the assessment of the corresponding uncertainties. The downscaled fields were used to derive areadepth-duration-frequency (ADDF) curves, and area-reduction-factors (ARF) for selected regions in Germany. The estimated curves were compared to those derived from a reference weather radar data set. While the corrected and downscaled data show good agreement with the observed reference data over all temporal and spatial scales, the future climate simulations indicate an increase in the estimated areal rainfall depth for future periods. Moreover, the future ARFs for short durations and large spatial scales increase compared to the reference value, while for longer durations the difference is smaller." ;

        dct:title                 "This work presents a methodology to inspect the changing statistical properties of precipitation extremes with climate change. Data from regional climate models for the European continent (EURO-CORDEX 11) were used. The use of climate model data requires first an inspection of the data and a correction of the biases of the meteorological model. Both the correction of biases of the point precipitation and those of the spatial structure were performed. For this purpose, a quantilequantile transformation of the point precipitation and a spatial recorrelation method were used. Once bias-corrected, the data from the regional climate model were downscaled to a finer spatial scale using a stochastic method with equally probable outcomes. This enables the assessment of the corresponding uncertainties. The downscaled fields were used to derive areadepth-duration-frequency (ADDF) curves, and area-reduction-factors (ARF) for selected regions in Germany. The estimated curves were compared to those derived from a reference weather radar data set. While the corrected and downscaled data show good agreement with the observed reference data over all temporal and spatial scales, the future climate simulations indicate an increase in the estimated areal rainfall depth for future periods. Moreover, the future ARFs for short durations and large spatial scales increase compared to the reference value, while for longer durations the difference is smaller." ;

Often a test distribution is compared to a theoretical one. The comparison is based on the quantiles. Namely, a scatter plot between the quantiles of both data values is constructed. If the data have the same distribution function, the QQ plot will be defined by a linear function (y=x). To derive the QQ plot, the data of the two distribution functions are sorted, and their quantiles are calculated. In this section, a QQ mapping was applied to correct the bias in the projected model data while preserving the ranks of the values. An example of this was shown by Bárdossy and Pegram (2011) where the distribution function of regional climate models (RCM) was corrected using a double QQ transformation as defined by equation 5. For this, the CDF of the upscaled reference data at location X (for example DWD interp ) and the CDF of the recorrelated model data for the historical and future periods for the same location X were used. For the observation and historical data, a Weibull distribution function with three parameters was fitted using the maximum likelihood method (Singh, 1987). The latter was chosen as it provided the best fit. Bárdossy, 2019). The extrapolation using the exponential distribution is defined by equation 6. Let (Z m , U m ) define the pair of the largest precipitation observation and corresponding quantile, the parameter λ is calculated following equation 7. This enables correcting the RCP future data while allowing for maximum values to exceed the current observed values. In panel (a) of Figure 7 the x-axis refers to precipitation in millimeters and the y-axis to the cumulative probabilities. The red curve is the distribution function of the reference data DWD interp . The green curve is the RCM distribution for the historical period and the blue curve shows the RCM curve for a future scenario. For every precipitation value in the future data, the corresponding value in the historical data is found and for that, the corresponding value for the same quantile level in the observations data is assigned as the future value. An example of this is presented in Figure 7. In panel (a), the blue curve refers to the EURO-CORDEX historical data after the recorrelation procedure, the green curve to the recorrelated RCP8.5 data, and the red curve to the reference data DWD interp for the observation period. The black curve shows the double-QQ corrected RCP8.5 distribution function using the previously described procedure. Panel (b) displays a scatter plot of the values after recorrelation (gray dots) and after the recorrelation and double-QQ mapping (blue dots). The red line refers to the raw RCP8.5 data. Panel (c) displays the CDF of DWD interp , Radar avg , the EURO-CORDEX historical, and the RCP8.5 data before and after correction for the same grid cell location. The Radar avg indicate a smaller maximum value compared to DWD interp , though both distributions show few differences. Similarly to the recorrelation procedure, the double-QQ correction was done for every duration separately. Note that this section refers to part (b) in the flowchart in Figure 2. This double-QQ transformation reduces the bias in the model data while preserving the signal in the RCP data (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2011). The final recorrelated and double-QQ corrected data are used for downscaling and investigating the areal rainfall statistics." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "The random mixing methods allow capturing the spatial dependence structure through a spatial copula function. A copula is a mathematical function used to derive and model the dependence between variables independently of their distribution functions. If a spatial copula function was used, the asymmetry of the spatial field could be better taken into account (asymmetry can be viewed as the measure of skewness of univariate data). Another advantage of random mixing is the possibility to include multiple conditional observations that can be integrated as linear (equality) or non-linear (inequality) constraints. As a stochastic method, several equally possible realistic realizations of a certain event (or time step) can be derived along the associated mean uncertainty field. In this work, random mixing was used to upscale and downscale the DWD point observations to the EURO-CORDEX scale and vice-versa. The RMWSPy Python package was used to that end (Hörning and Haese, 2021). First, based on the DWD point data for the period 2005-2020, conditional fields were simulated for every time step with precipitation > 1 mm. The simulated fields were conditioned on the DWD point observations, the corresponding marginal distribution function, and the fitted covariance (or variogram) model representing the spatial dependence structure. In this step, the calculated experimental variogram was normed and saved. Note that because the variogram was calculated in the rank space, its estimation was smoother than by using the original observations. Eventually, a K-mean clustering was applied and three clusters of variograms were identified (Hartigan and Wong, 1979). Different numbers of clusters were tested, but the chosen number of clusters (3) was found to be the most suitable as the fitted models were the most distinct. For each cluster, the mean variogram was calculated and an exponential variogram without a nugget was fitted. Since the EURO-CORDEX data are on the grid cell scale, the estimated spatial model is smoother than that of the point scale. Hence, for downscaling, the spatial dependence model calculated from the grid cell values needed to be rescaled to the point scale. To that end, using the EURO-CORDEX data the experimental variograms were calculated, and a similar clustering approach was https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-288 Preprint. Discussion started: 16 January 2024 c Author(s) 2024. CC BY 4.0 License. applied. This allowed assigning for every time step (for every duration) a suitable variogram. A similar approach of variogram clustering was presented in Bárdossy et al. (2021). Figure 8 shows the fitted exponential variograms to each average cluster variogram from the point and model data. The grid cell variograms show similar behaviour as those derived from the point scale but with a smaller variance and a larger range. In other terms, for the same separating distance, the variance of the grid cell model is smaller than that of the point model. For each time step in the RCP8.5 data, the corresponding variogram cluster was identified and the corresponding point scale variogram was used to rescale the spatial model. Without rescaling the grid cell variogram to the point variogram, the downscaled fields would be much smoother than the actual 1 km fields. After correcting the spatial dependence structure and the bias in the CDF of the future RCP data, conditional realizations (conditioned on the model areal averages) at a finer spatial scale of 1 km (the weather radar grid) were generated using random mixing. Hence, the downscaling part. Note that this section corresponds to part (c) in the flowchart shown in Figure 2. This process incorporates the climate signal from the projections and provides a dataset that can be used to derive future ADDF curves for the study area. To account for the uncertainty acquired by the simulation approach, 50 downscaled and equally probable time series for every pixel in the simulation domain were generated. The step-by-step procedure to downscale the EURO-CORDEX RCP8.5 data for the period 2005-2099 for a given Area-DDF location using random mixing is described below: 1. Create a buffer enclosing the ADDF largest area (1024 km 2 ). 2. Find all EURO-CORDEX grid cells falling within the buffer (conditional values). 3. Find all radar pixels falling within the buffer (simulation domain" ;

Regional climate models provide useful information about climatic data for historical and future scenarios. These have been generated based on increasing emission levels, hence, changing the physical, energetic, and thermodynamic balance between the atmospheric components. The outcome of RCM data is in general too coarse for local analysis and often spatial or/and temporal downscaling is applied. The final results show realistic ADDF curves and ARF values that can be used for impact analysis. Main messages behind this manuscript: 1. Using regional climate model data directly leads to an overestimation of the areal extremes. 2. Correcting the spatial dependence structure and the magnitudes of the data improves the usability of the data. 3. Spatial downscaling using random mixing is possible and offers uncertainty intervals. 4. The signal in the RCP is not lost and is present in the future areal extremes. 5. The corrected data of the RCP8.5 scenario indicate an increase in the rainfall depth over all temporal and spatial scales. The study could be further extended and applied to several GCM-RCM products. This will provide an ensemble of possible uncertainty scenarios for future projections of DDF and ADDF curves. Although the procedure would be similar for the different GMC-RCM combinations, the results might differ. The procedure could be also further evaluated for other geographical locations. Moreover, instead of working with ADDF areas, a selected catchment could have been used. The resulting future areal precipitation extremes could be integrated into a hydrological model to assess the impact on the discharge values." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "The procedure for analyzing, correcting, and downscaling the RCM data is divided into three parts and is presented in Figure 2. First, the spatial dependence structure of the model needs to be corrected according to a reference-based structure. The correction of the distribution of the point precipitation amounts is done subsequently. In order that the biased precipitation amount distribution should not influence the spatial structure, it was derived on the basis of the pixel-wise rank correlation using a reference data set (for example, DWD interp ). The correction is based on a recorrelation procedure described in section 3.1. The dependence structure affects greatly the areal extremes, especially for large spatial events (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2012). This part refers to section (a) of the flowchart in Figure 2. Once the dependence structure has been corrected, any remaining bias in the marginal distribution function of future climate projections has to be handled. For this, a double-QQ transformation involving information from the reference data and the model historical data was applied (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2011). This section represents part (b) of the flowchart in Figure 2. Afterwards, the final corrected data are downscaled using a stochastic simulation algorithm (random mixing, (Bárdossy and Hörning, 2016b)) to the finer spatial resolution of 1 km. The final fields are eventually used for the analysis of the spatial extent of extremes via area-depth-duration-frequency (ADDF) curves. The ADDF curves were calculated on the pixel-scale (1 km 2 area), for different areas (up to 1024 km 2 ) and durations (hourly to daily). The possible impact of climate change on the statistics of areal extremes was to be investigated. Note that this section refers to part (c) of the flowchart in Figure 2" ;

        nif:anchorOf              "The spatial dependence of precipitation plays a major role in the distribution of areal rainfall and the corresponding extremes. An often neglected problem is whether regional climate models can replicate the observed dependence structure. In (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2012) this problem was discussed and a possible solution was presented. A similar procedure was here implemented, however, using a finer spatial and temporal resolution and instead of the Pearson correlation a rank correlation type method was used with normal score transformed variables. To account for different precipitation mechanisms and characteristics, the reference and model data were divided between the summer (April-September) and winter (October-March) seasons, and for each period the dependence structure was derived. A special challenge while working with sub-daily and especially hourly precipitation data is the large number of 0 mm precipitation values (around 80%). DWD interp data (red dots). The DWD point correlation values are lower than those of the DWD interp data. This difference can be justified theoretically -assuming stationarity of the spatial dependence -as the interblock variability leads to the reduction of the variance. In fact, the covariance between two grid cells V i and V j can be written as a function of the covariance function of the point values C(x, y): While for the variance of the grid cell V : Both the covariance and the variance decrease. The decrease of the covariance is less than or equal to that of the variance, thus the correlation increases. Thus due to scale difference, using the DWD point correlation structure as a reference for the correction of the EURO-CORDEX spatial structure would be incorrect. In  The procedure presented by Bárdossy and Pegram (2012) used a mixed-type distribution, defined by a censored Gaussian copula to transform the daily precipitation data to the normal space, and a matrix recorrelation procedure based on linear algebra was implemented. The aim was to recorrelate the model data to obtain the same reference dependence structure. The latter was derived by calculating the Pearson correlation between the daily precipitation time series at the different grid cell locations. A similar procedure was implemented in this section, however, using the theoretical correlation of the normal score transformed data. A normal score transformation cannot be performed directly due to the large portion of zero values. Thus, instead, indicator series were used. The indicator series I(t, u) were calculated for the reference and model data given a probability level α. Several threshold values were tested, and the value α = 0.9 was selected as it provided the best recorrelation results. Let F (t, u) be the distribution function of the precipitation time series Z at location u. The indicator series can be calculated using equation 3. After converting the reference and model data to indicator series (0 and 1), the pair-wise correlation between two indicator series ρ i (u, v) was calculated. The indicator correlation matrix for the reference data is defined by R i and for the model data by M i . For a given probability value α, there is a one to one relationship between the indicator correlation corresponding to two locations u and v (ρ i (u, v)) and the correlation of a bivariate Gaussian variable (ρ g (u, v)) which has the same indicator correlation.  Here y α corresponds to the α probability standard normal distribution function The estimation of ρ g (u, v) has to be carried out numerically. Using the relation in equation 4, both indicator correlation matrices (describing the correlation between the grid points) of the reference and model data R i and M i were transformed to Gaussian correlation matrices R g and M g . To ensure that the correlation matrices for the grids, R g and M g , are positive semidefinite, minor modifications to the correlation values were undertaken while minimizing the distance between the original matrices (R g and M g ) and the modified matrices (R * g and M * g ) (Bárdossy and Plate, 1992). From this point on, the matrix R * g was transformed to the matrix S g by calculating the square root of applying single value decomposition (SVD) to R * g . Afterward, the correlation matrix M * g was transformed to T g by calculating the inverse square root of applying SVD to M * g . The recorrelation matrix F = T g S g was used to recorrelate M * g to R * g by matrix multiplication The values in V g are in the Gaussian space and can be back-transformed to indicator correlations using a QQ transformation. Eventually, the model precipitation data were recorrelated using the recorrelation matrix F . Any negative values after recorrelation were set to 0 precipitation value. The flowchart in Figure 4 gives an overview of the recorrelation steps. The recorrelation matrix F derived from the historical observations for each season separately can be used to recorrelate projected RCP scenarios. This is possible since the model's historical and future dependence structures are highly similar (see Figure A1). In Figure 6, the correlation values of the recorrelated grid cells are calculated as a function of the separating distance. Similar to Figure 3  The recorrealtion procedure was done for every duration (from hourly to daily) separately. This provided consistent results for all durations. Note that this complete part refers to section (a) of the flowchart in Figure 2. After correcting the dependence structure, the marginal distribution function of the model's future data were corrected using a double QQ transformation." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "To estimate rainfall depth for design values, a statistical analysis of rainfall maxima derived from long records is required. In general, design values are associated with the corresponding duration and return period. The previous concept forms the basis of statistical analysis of heavy rainfall. Rainfall maxima are extracted from the observation time series for the different durations either by considering the yearly maxima (annual series) or the values exceeding a minimal threshold (partial series). The relation between rainfall depth, duration, and return period is commonly known as the Depth-Duration-Frequency (DDF) or Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve. The idea behind the DDF curve is to derive a mathematical expression relating the average rainfall intensity (i) occurring over a timescale (d) for a predefined return period (T) (Koutsoyiannis and Papalexiou, 2017). DDF curves are used to estimate the probability of non-exceedance of a certain rainfall amount for a given duration. These can be derived by a frequency analysis of the observed station data for different durations. Standard practice is to fit to the empirically calculated DDF curve a theoretical extreme value distribution function (e.g., Gumbel Type I), from which one can derive the possible rainfall depth (or intensity) for a certain return period and timescale. The reasoning behind fitting a distribution function to the sampled annual or partial maxima is that these represent only one realization of the possible rainfall values for the corresponding duration. In this work, the ADDF curves were derived from the observed annual series of 15 years (2005-2020), following the procedure described by the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste in DWA-A 532 (DWA-A, 2012). The extreme value distribution type I, known also as the Gumbel distribution function, is applied in the following form: Where: T n = return period of the annual maxima in years [a] u j , w j = parameters of the distribution function" ;

For example, the change between the ADDF values of the small areas (1 or 16 km 2 ) compared to the larger scale (576 or 1024 km 2 ) is different on the hourly scale than on the 6-hour scale (for example). The change between spatial scales decreases with increasing duration. Namely, a larger area reacts similarly to a smaller one for long durations. To illustrate this, the 1 hour and 6 hours duration were chosen as an example. For the hourly scale, the difference between the average estimated rainfall depth for the small area of 16 km 2 and the largest area of 1024 km 2 is around 25%  In Table 2, the average percentage of increase in the expected rainfall depth between the two time periods and for the different durations and area sizes is shown. The percentage was calculated as the ratio between the mean estimated rainfall depth for the two time periods 2005-2025 and 2065-2099 for the corresponding area size and duration. The results in Table 2 indicate that the impact of climate change on the different spatial scales is duration dependent. For instance, on the hourly scale, the percentage of increase is bigger for the larger areas than for the smaller areas, namely 15% for the area size of 1024 km 2 and 11% for the area size of 1 km 2 . This difference is minimal for durations longer than 8 hours. For instance, on the 18-hour duration, all area sizes have a similar percentage of increase (≈ 23%). On the other hand, the percentage of increase changes with the duration for a fixed area size. For example, for the area size of 100 km 2 , the increase for the hourly duration is 12% while for the daily duration, it is 28%. One would expect a monotonic increase with the area size and duration. This is mostly the case, except for some area sizes and duration (for example, for the duration of 6 hours, the area size of 256 km 2 shows a" ;

        nif:anchorOf              "For precipitation volumes, the consideration of the areal mean is required. The calculation of the Area-DDF (ADDF) curves is not straightforward, as in contrast to point precipitation areal precipitation is not measured but has to be estimated. Further, the distribution of the areal precipitation amounts differs from the distribution of point values. For example, using the weather radar data for a target location of an area of 1000 km 2 , all pixels located within the area are identified, and for every time step the average of all the pixels is calculated. Eventually, a time series is acquired and used as input to the DDF calculation procedure. Bennett et al. (2016) first suggested the use of interpolated rainfall data for the direct estimation of the statistics of areal extremes by introducing the intensity-duration-frequency-area curves. The need for ARF to convert points to spatial rainfall would be then eliminated. Radar-derived precipitation data can be used to calculate the ADDF curves. However, the quality of the radar reference data and the relatively short observation time period highly influence the results (Haberlandt and Berndt, 2016a). Marra and Morin (2015) used radar QPE to derive IDF curves for the region of Israel and compared the results to nearby rain gauges. Despite efforts to reduce errors in the radar QPE, the final results showed an overestimation of radar-derived IDF curves. An effect that increased with larger durations. Another study done by Ghebreyesus and Sharif (2021) using the radar QPE data over the state of Texas to derive state-wide IDF curves showed mostly an underestimation of short-duration maxima. The goal of using the radar QPE data is to be able to derive spatially and temporally reliable IDF curves, eliminating the need for area reduction factors (Ghebreyesus and Sharif, 2021). Areal precipitation extremes derived from weather radar data are prone to errors (Schleiss et al., 2020). For instance, due to attenuation, beam blockage, sub-scale variability, and simplified Z-R relation (Villarini and Krajewski, 2010). However, as there is still no possibility to correctly measure areal extremes, the error term cannot be easily quantified. In addition, the rain gauge observations are sparse. Many short-duration intense rainfall events cannot be correctly sampled, and many are completely missed (Lengfeld et al., 2020). The high spatial and temporal availability of the RADOLAN-RW merged stationradar data makes it advantageous for the analysis of areal extremes and was used in this study for the estimation of reference ADDF curves (DWD Climate Data Center (CDC), 2021b). However, due to the limited available temporal period, the ADDF curves were derived for return periods of 5 years. Such short return periods are relevant for the design of urban drainage networks." ;

Fit a non-parametric marginal distribution using Kernel density estimate with Gaussian kernel. 6. Derive the CDF and its inverse (invcdf ) by optimizing the kernel width. 7. Transform the observations to standard normal space using the fitted CDF. 8. Fit an exponential covariance model. 9. Scale the model to match the reference point model. 10. Run conditional simulations (50 simulations) 11. Back-transform to original data space using invcdf . 12. Repeat for the next time steps. An example of the simulation domain for one ADDF location is shown in panel (a) of Figure 9. The domain shown in red has a total area of 1024 km 2 . Within this domain, the areas of 1, 16, 36, 100, 256, 576, and 1024 km 2 were considered for deriving the ADDF curves. These are derived as DDF curves but by using a time series of the average of all pixels within each area. For example, for the area size of 1024 km 2 , for every time step the average of the pixels enclosed by this area (pixels in red) was calculated. Using the same procedure for DDF curves (described in section 3.3), the ADDF curve for this area was derived. In panel (a), the gray pixels represent the complete simulation domain and the blue dots are the center of the EURO-CORDEX grid cells. The precipitation values at these grid cells were used as equality constraints in the downscaling part. To showcase the influence of the variogram scaling procedure, two different spatial dependence models were used, model M2 (derived from EURO-CORDEX data) and model P2 (derived from DWD point ). Both can be seen in panel (b) of Figure 8. Because the simulations using random mixing are stochastic, it is difficult to compare them, hence, for comparison purposes, the average of 50 simulations was considered. Therefore, 50 realizations were generated using both models and the average fields were compared. Panels (b) and (c) in Figure 9 display the average fields using model M2 and model P2, respectively. Note that the main difference in the spatial models is their range and how they approach the asymptotic limit. In panel (b), the larger range in model M2 is reflected by larger connected high (or low) rainfall grid cells and less variability in the final field, noted by the transition between wet (or high) and dry (or low) rainfall areas. The field in panel (c) based on model P2 has more variability and the smaller range is reflected by more discontinuities between the high and low values. Note that both average fields were conditioned on the same recorrelated and double-QQ corrected RCP8.5 data. Hence, to account for this difference in the sub-scale downscaled fields, the grid cell variograms needed to be rescaled to the point scale. The downscaled fields are used to calculate the ADDF for selected regions/pixels in the study area. The aim is to derive areal extremes for future periods, particularly from the RCP8.5 data. The realizations generated by the conditional simulations are all equally probable but limited to spatial constraints and not temporally correlated (e.g., advection is not included). Therefore, for each time step with precipitation> 1 mm, 50 simulations were generated across the simulation domain for each duration separately. This was essential, otherwise, the fields would not be space-time continuous. For example, on the hourly scale, each realization for each time step will most likely be different from the realization of the next time step, despite being equally probable and statistically correct. Aggregating these fields will lead to an incorrect representation of the areal rainfall. A simple but computationally intensive solution was to aggregate the hourly corrected data for each required duration and rerun the simulations again. A different possible solution would have been to use the generated fields for time step i as unconditional fields (instead of random fields) for time step i+1. This would have required modifying the simulation algorithm to include time as a third dimension. However, since the focus is on areal statistics, especially annual maxima, and not on event reconstruction, the first solution was seen as adequate enough for this scope. Moreover, an alternative stochastic simulation approach could have been tested. For example, Papalexiou et al. (2021) and Bárdossy and Hörning (2023) present frameworks for simulating space-time rainfall fields with characteristics such as velocity field, advection, anisotropy, and a flexible dependence structure. After the simulations were completed, the ADDF curves for the area size of 1 km 2 were calculated from the generated time series for four different time periods, 2005-2025, 2026-2045, 2046-2064, and 2065-2099. For comparison . For comparison  Compared to the RADOLAN data, the raw RCP8.5 values for both periods show an overestimation of the maxima over all durations. The final corrected values (green boxes), however, fall within the range of the RADOLAN data and show a good agreement for the period 2005-2025. Additionally, the boxplots of the raw data indicate a larger range compared to the corrected data. For example, the estimated rainfall depth from raw data for the duration of 720 min (12 hours) varies between 40 and 100 mm with a mean value of 60 mm. However, in the corrected data, the range is between 25 and 40 mm. This indicates that the raw data has greater spread and variability, which makes it difficult to use a trustworthy uncertainty interval. Using the double-QQ correction alone improved the results compared to the RCP8.5 raw data but was still far from the RADOLAN data. This also indicates the need for correction of the spatial dependence structure. In all data sets, an increase in the expected rainfall depth from the first to the second period is clearly visible. Though with different magnitudes. Panel (b) of Figure 10 shows the ADDF for the period 2065-2099 and indicates an increase in the expected rainfall depth for all durations and a return period of 5 years. However, the increase is not homogeneous across all durations and varies accordingly." ;

The weather radar is positioned at the Hannover airport and has a coverage radius of 128 km. The north of the region is generally flat, and moving towards the southeast the elevation increases to 1141 m a.s.l. in the Harz Mountains. The average yearly precipitation ranges from 500 to 1700 mm yr 1 (Haberlandt and Berndt, 2016b). Following previous studies on the space-time statistics of rainfall extremes, the latter was selected as the study area (El Hachem et al., 2022;Goshtsasbpour et al., 2022). https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-288 Preprint. Discussion started: 16 January 2024 c Author(s) 2024. CC BY 4.0 License. Within this region, the German Weather Service (DWD) operates a precipitation measurement network of 127 rain gauges with sub-hourly resolution (DWD Climate Data Center (CDC), 2021a). The data for these stations were acquired for the years between 2005 and 2020. Moreover, the hourly weather radar data (RADOLAN-RW) for the period 2005-2020 were used. The latter is the operational DWD radar composite. It is a merged product of the derived precipitation fields from all available weather radars and the DWD rain gauges. The data were made available by the DWD (DWD Climate Data Center (CDC), 2021b). For this study, only the observations lying within the radar area of Hannover were extracted. The third data set is the EURO-CORDEX data. These have been provided within the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) for the European continent with two horizontal simulation domains of 50 km (EUR-44) and 12.5 km (EUR-11). The simulation output consists of several data sets with hourly resolution representing different atmospheric and surface-near variables such as precipitation (Jacob et al., 2014). The REgional MOdel (REMO) is especially advantageous for precipitation analysis on the hourly scale since advection is integrated within the parameterization scheme (Jacob and Podzun, 1997;Jacob, 2001). In this work, the MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR-GERICS-REMO2015-v1 developed by the Max-Planck-Institute für Meteorologie (MPI-M) and the Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS) was used. The data were made available by the ClimXtreme Central Evaluation System framework (Kadow et al., 2021). The goal is to find the reliability/usability of the RCM model data for areal precipitation analysis with a special focus on extremes. Since the model data consist of grid cell averages, it is not suitable to compare them to rain gauge (point) data. Hence, the first reference data was based on interpolated fields using the DWD station data (refered to as DWD point ). The interpolation was carried out using Ordinary Kriging and the weather radar observation grid of 1 km was used as the interpolation grid. The resulting fields were then spatially aggregated to match the EURO-CORDEX 11 • grid. This reference data set will be denoted hereafter as DWD interp . The second data set is the spatially averaged radar data for the period 2005-2020. The aggregated 150 data match the model grid and are denoted hereafter as Radar avg . Note that in all cases the arithmetic mean of the 1 km pixels falling within each model cell was calculated and assigned to the corresponding model pixel. A summary of the used data sets is presented in Table 1." ;

In general, most interpolation techniques can only provide smoothed fields because, in all Kriging applications, the equation system is solved by minimizing the estimation variance. Hence, the interpolated fields have less variability than the original one. However, for hydrological applications, many processes are driven by variability rather than the average values. To this end, a simulation of many possible realistic realizations with the same dependence structure can offer the corresponding variability. In general, there are two main types of simulation methods: conditional and unconditional simulations. Random mixing is a conditional simulation method that allows the stochastic generation of realizations that satisfy multiple conditions (Bárdossy and Hörning, 2016b). The method is extended from the work of Hu (2000) regarding the gradual deformation of Gaussian fields. In order to achieve the goal of having realistic realizations, the following criteria must be fulfilled by the simulated field: 1. Match the measured data (conditioned on observations). 2. Have the same spatial dependence structure (represented by a variogram or spatial copula function)." ;

One of the important issues in this context is how magnitudes and frequencies of extremes will change. A large number of studies were conducted to investigate this issue. In general, global climate models (GCMs) are used to model the past changes (forced by observations) in climate systems on a global scale and to project future changes (forced by emissions scenarios) (Randall et al., 2007). These are based on the numerical solution of mathematical representations of the physical processes and their interactions (such as the conservation of energy, mass, and momentum, the thermodynamic equations such as the gas law, and the connection of processes on land with the atmosphere and vice-versa) (Randall et al., 2007;Hennemuth et al., 2017). GCM provides output variables with a relatively coarse space-time resolution, typically between 100 and 500 km 2 , and for 6-hour intervals (Stocker, 2014). However, the transfer and use of global results to local and regional climate analysis, especially for hydrological processes such as precipitation, requires a finer space-time resolution, which can be achieved https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-288 Preprint.

(2017) derived future IDF curves for South Korea from daily RCM data through stochastic downscaling to sub-daily resolutions incorporated into a Bayesian inference framework. The results indicate an increase in the expected rainfall from 5 to 30% under the RCP8.5 scenario. Other works also exist, for example, Hosseinzadehtalaei et al. (2018) derived future IDF for Belgium, Forestieri et al. (2018) for Sicily in Italy and for Iran (Khazaei, 2021). Many of the previous studies consider deriving the DDF (or IDF) for the point scale. Traditionally area reduction factors (ARF) are used to transfer the point value to the areal (or catchment) scale. These are in general based on simple assumptions, and the effect of climate change is not considered. However, the consequences of heavy precipitation, such as flooding, are related to the volume of water, so the spatial aspect should not be ignored. This work considers precipitation as a spatial phenomenon, without purely point statistics, and aims to assess the expected change in future areal precipitation extremes under the RCP8.5 scenario compared to reference data and the present period. This is done by calculating area-depth-durationfrequency curves (ADDF) over several durations (hourly to daily) and over different spatial scales from 1 to 1000 km 2 . Essential questions to be investigated in this work are: 1. Knowing that precipitation extremes look different depending on scales, to what extent can the climate model produce extremes correctly? 2. How can spatial and temporal dependence structures of climate models be successfully corrected?" ;
