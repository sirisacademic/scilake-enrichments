Depositions of α-synuclein, a pathological hallmark of DLB, can induce network excitability, which can escalate into seizure activity. Indicator of seizures are epileptiform discharges as observed using electroencephalography (EEG). However, no studies have so far investigated the occurrence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in patients with DLB. Objectives: To investigate if IED as measured with ear-EEG occurs with a higher frequency in patients with DLB compared to healthy controls (HC). Methods: In this longitudinal observational exploratory study, 10 patients with DLB and 15 HC were included in the analysis. Patients with DLB underwent up to three ear-EEG recordings, each lasting up to 2 days, over a period of 6 months.Results: At baseline, IED were detected in 80% of patients with DLB and in 46.7% of HC. The spike frequency (spikes or sharp waves/24 hours) was significantly higher in patients with DLB as compared to HC with a risk ratio of 2.52 (CI, 1.42-4.61; P-value = 0.001). Most IED occurred at night. Conclusions: Long-term outpatient ear-EEG monitoring detects IED in most patients with DLB with an increased spike frequency compared to HC. This study extends the spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders in which epileptiform discharges occurs at an elevated frequency. It is possible that epileptiform discharges are, therefore, a consequence of neurodegeneration.

This study extends the spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders in which epileptiform discharges occurs at an elevated frequency. It is possible that epileptiform discharges are, therefore, a consequence of neurodegeneration. Patients with Lewy body dementia (DLB) have a higher risk of developing seizures than the general population. 1 Case reports have shown that patients with DLB may present with epilepsy 2,3 or patients with epilepsy showing symptoms mimicking DLB. 4 Further, since the early features of DLB may bear resemblance to nonconvulsive seizures, as for example, fluctuating cognition, a common feature in patient with DLB, 5 seizures may go undetected as has been shown in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1 As a possible biomarker for developing epileptic seizures, interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) such as spikes or sharp waves can be observed using electroencephalography (EEG). Recently, studies have found that patients with AD have a higher rate of IED when measured with long-term EEG [6][7][8] and a study found improved cognition after administration of levetiracetam in patients with AD who had IED. 9 However, no studies have so far investigated the prevalence of IED using long-term EEG in patients with DLB. In mouse models of α-synucleinopathy, one study found a link between network hyperexcitability as detected by IED, occurring during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. 10 Although atrophy of the temporal lobes is generally not as pronounced in DLB as in AD, 11 one study has suggested that a higher density of Lewy bodies is present in the temporal lobes. 12 Furthermore, in Parkinson's disease visual hallucinations may be related to IED originating from the temporal lobes. 13 Because of the possible clinical relevance of detecting IED, there is a need for accessible and dependable EEG monitoring in an outpatient setting. One method is ear-EEG 14 where the EEG signals are recorded from electrodes placed within a customized earpiece inserted into each ear and is associated with little interference of everyday life. [14][15][16] Recently, ear-EEG has shown to be feasible for long-term outpatient ear-EEG monitoring in patients with AD 17 and has been shown to be able to detect IED in patients with temporal lobe seizures. 18 Because of the symptoms being associated with temporal lobe structures, it is plausible that ear-EEG can capture IED in patients with DLB. In the current study exploratory study, we investigated if IED as measured with ear-EEG occurs with a higher frequency in patients with DLB compared to healthy controls.  Patients with mild to moderate DLB were recruited from the Memory Clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital-Rigshospitalet and the Memory Clinic at Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde. All patients met the DLB Consortium criteria for DLB. 19 Inclusion criteria were (1) a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 20 score of 16 to 28; (2) age between 50 and 90 years; (3) native Danish speaker; (4) at least 7 years of education; (5) hearing and vision sufficient for neuropsychological examination; (6) no alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years; (7) no contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (8) an MRI or computed tomography (CT); (9) the general health conditions of the patient allowed participation in the study (as judged by the principal investigator); and (10) living with a caregiver who was able to assist the patient with the home recordings. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) epilepsy before the diagnosis of DLB; (2) focal pathology (except DLB related atrophy) in the hippocampus (ie, hippocampal sclerosis); (3) living with a relative with serious illness or impaired activities of daily living; (4) living in a nursing home; (5) psychiatric (except mild depression) or neurological conditions that affects the brain except DLB; (6) currently treated with antiepileptic medication, tricyclic antidepressants, or antipsychotics; (7) daily or almost daily administration of medication with known anticholinergic or adrenergic effect, which may affect cognitive abilities or EEG; (8) large cerebral infarctions or more than four lacunar infarctions on MRI; (9) suffering from facial tics/facial hyperkinetic disorders; or (10) daily use of hearing aids. The healthy controls (HC) were all participants in other studies and had expressed interest in participating in new studies. The inclusion criteria were (1) normal cognition (as judged by the principal investigator); (2) the general health allowed participation in the study; and (3) did not suffer from any psychiatric (except mild depressive symptoms or mild depression) or neurological conditions that affect the brain as well as criteria 2 to 7 as applied in patients with DLB. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) diagnosed with epilepsy; and (2) focal pathology in the brain (except mild hippocampal atrophy) as well as exclusion criteria 5 to 10 as applied in patients with DLB, but without DLB. The data from the HC has also been published in a previous study. 21 The study was approved by the Capital Region Ethics Committee (H-17035751), the Danish Medicines Agency (2017112288), and the Data Protection Agency (P-2021-866). All participants gave their written informed consent before participating in the study. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04436341). In this longitudinal study, a total of eight visits were planned over a 6-month period for patients with DLB and a total of four visits for the HC (see Figure 1). In patients with DLB, the 3 2-day ear-EEG recordings were planned 3 months apart, that is, at the beginning of the study (baseline), at 3 months, and at 6 months follow-up. At visit 1 (baseline), informed consent was obtained followed by assessment of medical history, a physical and neurological examination, the MMSE and an imprint of the ears using Otoform A Soft X (Dreve, Germany), a soft ear impression silicone. Subsequently, the patient underwent the following: visit 2, MRI scan to evaluate exclusion criteria related to possible pathology or infarctions; visit 3 standard EEG recording together with ear-EEG, Functional Assessment Questionnaire Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (FAQ IADL) 22 (to assess everyday function), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) 23 (to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms), and the Category Cued Memory Test (CCMT) 24 to assess memory function. Further, the patient and the caregiver were briefly instructed about seizures and introduced to a seizure diary to take home to note any symptoms of seizures (such abdominal aura or automatisms, jerks, rapid changes of awareness, and in cognition). Information and training on how to use the ear-EEG at home were conducted. This included a log-sheet to take notes on when the participant wore the ear-EEG equipment. After $48 hours (visit 4) the patient and/or the caregiver returned with the equipment and the patient filled a questionnaire. The external ear was examined for any minor lesions when the patient was present to return the equipment (visit 4, 6, and 8) and participants were queried regarding any possible adverse events. Visit 5 and 6, and visits 7 and 8 were similar to visits 3 and 4 except that MMSE was performed at visit 5 and 7. Based on the experiences gathered in the feasibility study, 17 breaks were permitted throughout the recording periods where the participants were allowed to take out the ear-EEG. Emphasis was put on recordings during the night, so participants were encouraged to wear the ear-EEG especially during the night. HC only had a single recording session with ear-EEG. The program for the HC was similar to the program for DLB patients except for the fact that the FAQ IADL and NPI were not administered. A short questionnaire about the use of the ear-EEG was administered to DLB patients at visit 4, 6, and 8. See Supplementary Data S1. The ear-EEG earpieces were custom-made in silicone and mounted with six dry-electrodes 14 (T&W Engineering, Denmark). The earpiece was placed inside the ear canal and in the concha 25 in both ears with the labeling of the ear-EEG electrodes being previously described. 26 The ground electrode was placed $2 cm under the midline of the clavicle on either one side. The ear-EEG recordings were performed using the TMSi Mobita EEG amplifier (TMSi systems, the Netherlands), which was worn in either a small bag around the neck or in a belt bag and connected to the electrodes. The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. The EEG data were loaded into MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, v2020b) and the EEGLAB 27 data structure was used throughout the analysis. See feasibility study for a complete description of the preprocessing. 17 The amount of time when data from at least one electrode in each ear were present was calculated (afterward called preprocessed data). The amount of available data for each individual electrode and the amount of time preprocessed data on each ear were present during the night (10 PM-8 AM) and day (8 AM-10 PM) was examined. We performed 30-minutes 19-channel EEG recording at visit 4, 6, and 8. The protocol involved 10 minutes of resting state followed by 20 minutes of sleeping, see Supplementary Data S1 for full detail of the recording and assessment. Ear-EEG recordings were visually reviewed and annotated by C.S.M. using the EEGLAB toolbox (v13.6.5b) implemented in MATLAB (2020b). Specifics for montage can be seen in the Supplementary Data S1. All annotations of epileptiform discharges were based on visual assessment. A sharp asymmetric negative potential of 20 to 200 millisecond duration was considered an epileptiform discharge (spike/sharp wave) according to the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology criteria for defining IED. 28 The criteria compromised of (1) di-or tri-phasic with a pointed peak with (2) a different wave duration than the background activity; (3) asymmetry of the waveform; (4) background activity was disrupted by the presence of the epileptiform discharge and in some cases was (5) followed by a slow after-wave. Because of the nature of ear-EEG, we could not investigate the spatial distribution of the spikes/sharp waves (criteria 6). Practically, this led to most epileptiform discharges fulfilling at least four out of the six criteria. All annotations underwent review by a board-certified clinical neurophysiologist (T.W.K.), who made the final ruling. Both C.S.M. and T.W.K. were blinded to the diagnosis when reviewing the EEG results. For the ear-EEG analysis, we also included six of the HC to ensure blinding during the analysis. However, as these six HC had already been analyzed, the results from the reanalysis were discarded. The subsequent statistical analysis was, therefore, carried out on the original data as has previously been reported on. 21 The number of epileptiform discharges between the first analysis (n = 8) and the reanalysis (n = 9) was almost similar. All statistics were performed in RStudio (v1.2.1335). When comparing age, education, cognitive scores, and the length of ear-EEG recordings between DLB (at baseline) and HC, we performed two-sample t tests. The distribution of the data as well as the variance was checked. χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test (if one input variable being ≤5) was performed for comparing sex, the number of participants with EEG slowing, the number of participants with spike/sharp waves at baseline, and the number of spikes/night and spikes/day between DLB and HC. When comparing the number of spikes or sharp waves/24 hours (spike frequency) between HC, and DLB at baseline, we calculated the rate ratio using the function rateratio from the epitools toolbox. Spearman's correlation between the spike frequency across all recordings in DLB and cognitive tests was performed. Changes in spikes or sharp waves between visits were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed-effect model including visit number (categorical variable) and logtransformed the amount of pre-processed EEG (in minutes) as the offset variable with a person specific random intercept in a Poisson regression model using the lme4 package. Changes in MMSE over visits were analyzed using a linear mixed model including visit number (categorical) as fixed effect because a decrease was expected over time. An unstructured covariance pattern was used to account for repeated measurements on the same subjects with the LMMStar package.  A comparison of participant characteristics of the HC with and without epileptiform discharges was performed using two-sample Wilcoxon test (see Supplementary Data S1).  Ten patients with DLB and 15 HC were eligible for inclusion and gave informed consent. For the follow-up visits, eight patients with DLB participated in two ear-EEG recordings and seven in all three visits (see Supplementary Data S1 for the reasons for dropping out of the study). See Table 1 for demographics and cognitive scores. One patient with DLB was prescribed quetiapine after the first ear-EEG recording because of visual hallucinations. Ear-EEG at Baseline See Figure 2A for examples of IED. IED were detected in 80% (8/10) of patients with DLB and in 46.7% (7/15) of HC at baseline (P-value = 0.210), see Figure 2B. At baseline, the spike frequency was significantly higher in patients with DLB (range, 0-5.97; mean, 2.63 spikes/24 hours) as compared to HC (range, 0-6.66; mean, 1.04 spikes/24 hours) with a risk ratio of 2.52 (CI, 1.42-4.61, P-value = 0.001). See Figure 2C for an overview of the distribution of spikes. In patients with DLB, 59.3% of spikes occurred between 8 PM and 8 AM (see Fig. 2D), whereas this was true for 31.3% of HC (see Fig. 2E), but this was not significant between the groups (P-value = 0.076). One patient with DLB did not note time when wearing the ear-EEG at baseline. A comparison of the signal between ear-EEG and scalp-EEG can be seen in Supplementary Data S1. A considerable variance between the number of spikes across recordings was seen by significant difference in spike frequency between the baseline and the follow-up visits (visit 1-2: estimate, 0.33; P-value = 0.029; visit 1-3: estimate, 2.45; P-value = 0.002), see Supplementary Figure S1. At visit 3, one patient had 22 IED, which was considerably higher than the rest. If this observation was removed, no significant differences were found between visits 1 to 3. Combining all the recordings, we found that IED were found in 90% of DLB patients. When the spike frequency for all recordings was combined in patients with DLB, we found a spike frequency of 2.75 spikes/24 hours (70 IED, 25.45 days of preprocessed data). No significant differences were found for MMSE across visits (visit1-2: estimate, 0.88; P-value = 0.809; visit1-3: estimate, 1.34; P-value = 0.588) (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table 2). A significant correlation was found between the spike frequency in patients with DLB and the baseline MMSE (ρ = À0.80, P-value = 0.006). No significant correlations were found for immediate recall and delayed recall (Supplementary Figure S3). A comparison of the participant characteristics of the HC with and without epileptiform discharges can be found in the Supplementary Data S1. Regarding conventional EEG at both baseline and follow-up, we found that 80% (8/10) of patients with DLB had slowing in the EEG as compared to 6.7% (1/15) of HC (P-value = <0.001). Specifically, we found that half of the DLB patients (5/10) had disorganization or slowing of the background activity and 60% had 1865 focal slowing in one or both temporal lobes in one or more recordings. One patient with DLB had a lowvoltage EEG throughout three recordings. No IED were found during standard EEG recordings that were usually performed in early afternoon when a higher probability for short sleep was expected. A comparison between scalp-EEG and ear-EEG can be found in the Supplementary Data S1. The findings from the patient diaries can also be found in the Supplementary Data S1. At baseline, the mean number of recorded hours were 38.1 hours (standard deviation [SD], 10.5 hours) in patients with DLB as compared to 40.9 hours (SD, 9.5) in HC. The amount of preprocessed data was almost equal between patients with DLB with 28.2 hours (SD, 10.1 hours; range, 10.2-45.7 hours) as compared to HC with 27.7 hours (SD, 8.0 hours; range, 12.1-37.2 hours), P-value = 0.9, t-value = 0.2, df = 23. During the nighttime, 81.8% of the data in patients with DLB and 78.7% of data in HC remained after preprocessing as compared to the daytime with 66.1% of data in patients with AD and 63.9% of the data in HC. A total of 70% of patients with DLB had adverse events related to the ear-EEG as compared to 60% for HC. In patients with DLB, 60% reported some difficulty sleeping during the baseline recording. There were no reports that earplugs were dislodged by accident during routine activities. None of the adverse events related to ear-EEG were classified as serious adverse events. This is the first study to provide data on the prevalence of IED in patients with DLB using long-term EEG monitoring. At baseline, 80% of patients showed IED with a significantly increased risk ratio of 2.5 for spike frequency as compared to HC. Most IED occurred at night in patients with DLB. Considerable variability was observed between visits in patients with DLB. A significant negative correlation (ρ = À0.80) between MMSE and spike frequency was found in DLB. The data quality of the ear-EEG was of the same magnitude in DLB and HC, and participants experienced only mild adverse events related to the ear-EEG. This is the first study to investigate the prevalence of IED in patients with DLB. Multiple studies have found that a larger percentage of patients with AD without epilepsy have IED (22%-75%) on 24-hour EEG recordings as compared to HC. [6][7][8]21 In our study, there was no significant differences in the proportions of patients with DLB who had IED at baseline (80%) as compared to HC (46.7%), which we suspect might be because of the low sample size. That the majority of DLB patients had IED in our study was in contrast to no IED being found using short-term EEG recordings in the included DLB patients and that short-term conventional EEG recordings in a large mixed memory clinic cohort only found that 3% of participants had IED. 29 This is in line with studies showing an association between recording length and number of IED. 21,30 As the probability of detecting IED increases with the total observation time, long-term EEG recordings are important when investigating the use of antiepileptic medication in patients with DLB as to be able to measure a possible decrease in the occurrence of IED after antiseizure medication. The spike frequency was significantly higher in patients with DLB as compared to HC at baseline, 1867 which has also been found in patients with AD. [6][7][8]21 One explanation for the increased spike frequency could be depositions of α-synuclein, which has been shown to induce network excitability in transgenic mouse models 31 that can escalate into seizure activity. 32 In addition, one study found an association between the densities of Lewy bodies in the temporal lobes and visual hallucinations, 12 and visual hallucinations have been linked to IED in the temporal lobes in patients with Parkinson's disease. 13 However, because of a high frequency of amyloid deposition in DLB, 33,34 it is also possible that AD related pathology leads to IED in DLB patients (ie, that amyloid is the common denominator leading to IED) or that the neurodegenerative process per se leads to IED. However, studies in transgenic mouse models have found that α-synuclein aggregation alone is sufficient to cause network hyperexcitability. 10,31,32 It is also possible that more IED can be detected if measurements were made over the parietal or occipital cortex because of the location of neurodegeneration in patients with DLB. 11 A tendency toward more IED occurring at night was seen in patients with DLB (Fig. 2). In DLB, multiple studies have shown that REM sleep behavior disorder is common 35 and studies using polysomnography has shown sleep fragmentation and shortened REM time. 36 Because REM sleep has been shown to possibly inhibit IED 37,38 and this process becomes altered in patients with DLB, it is likely to worsen or possibly lead to IED during the neurodegenerative processes. This is in line with a study using mouse models of α-synucleinopathy, which found increasing IED during non-REM sleep. 10 Because of the small sample size, there is a need for a larger study to confirm the findings. Considerable variability between recordings was observed. It is possible that the variability is associated with cognitive fluctuations. A qualitative study suggested that fluctuation observed in DLB has a transient quality, which reflects an interruption of awareness. 39 Several theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism of fluctuations in patients with DLB. 40 One theory being atrophy of the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insular regions observed in patients with prodromal DLB, because these regions harbor neurons implicated in the integrity of attentional circuits. 41 Because of the location of the insular regions, it is plausible that the ear-EEG can capture IED originating from these areas. However, more studies are needed to understand if there is a link between fluctuations and IED in DLB. Our study has several limitations. First, the number of participants was low, which limits the generalizability of the study, and more studies are needed to understand the prevalence of spikes in patients with DLB. However, findings are in line with studies in AD, which have also shown increased epileptiform activity. We found a relatively high spike frequency in HC. This was surprising and may be because of the long recordings or undetected neurodegenerative pathology. Furthermore, no significant differences were found for the participant characteristics for HC with and without epileptiform discharges. Because of the low spatial resolution of ear-EEG, it is possible that false positive epileptiform discharges were annotated leading to an overestimation both in HC and DLB. Future studies should carry out studies on the validity of epileptiform discharges in ear-EEG as compared to scalp-EEG to directly compare epileptiform discharges as recorded by ear-EEG and scalp-EEG. Furthermore, we did not have multiple recordings in HC, which makes it difficult to understand if variability between recordings is seen in participants without a neurodegenerative disease. Here, we did not have any clinical scales for measuring fluctuations and could not directly investigate the link with IED. Another important aspect is the lack of characterization of sleep stages. However, automatic sleep staging tools for ear-EEG has been developed, 42 but validation in older cognitively healthy controls and/or patients with neurodegenerative diseases is needed. Furthermore, because of the low spatial resolution of the ear-EEG, it is possible that IED were missed because IED occur at areas associated with neurodegeneration in DLB. However, we were able to conduct long-term outpatient EEG recordings in patients with DLB, which showed significantly higher spike frequency as compared to HC. This is the first study to show that IED can be detected in patients with DLB using long-term outpatient ear-EEG monitoring. In patients with DLB, a significantly increased spike frequency was observed that mostly occurred at night. This supports previous findings in mouse models of α-synucleinopathy, which showed increased IED during sleep. Because IED have been shown to occur in both patients with AD and now DLB, it is likely that IED are an unspecific marker of neurodegeneration. However, studies are needed to understand if IED are more prevalent in other areas in DLB as compared to AD. We hypothesize that the variability between recordings could be associated with cognitive fluctuations as seen in DLB. Because recent clinical trials have shown promising effect of antiseizure medication in patients with AD and IED, this study shows the relevance of investigating the effect of anti-seizure medication in patients with DLB and IED.

In patients with DLB, the 3 2-day ear-EEG recordings were planned 3 months apart, that is, at the beginning of the study (baseline), at 3 months, and at 6 months follow-up. At visit 1 (baseline), informed consent was obtained followed by assessment of medical history, a physical and neurological examination, the MMSE and an imprint of the ears using Otoform A Soft X (Dreve, Germany), a soft ear impression silicone. Subsequently, the patient underwent the following: visit 2, MRI scan to evaluate exclusion criteria related to possible pathology or infarctions; visit 3 standard EEG recording together with ear-EEG, Functional Assessment Questionnaire Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (FAQ IADL) 22 (to assess everyday function), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) 23 (to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms), and the Category Cued Memory Test (CCMT) 24 to assess memory function. Further, the patient and the caregiver were briefly instructed about seizures and introduced to a seizure diary to take home to note any symptoms of seizures (such abdominal aura or automatisms, jerks, rapid changes of awareness, and in cognition). Information and training on how to use the ear-EEG at home were conducted. This included a log-sheet to take notes on when the participant wore the ear-EEG equipment. After $48 hours (visit 4) the patient and/or the caregiver returned with the equipment and the patient filled a questionnaire. The external ear was examined for any minor lesions when the patient was present to return the equipment (visit 4, 6, and 8) and participants were queried regarding any possible adverse events. Visit 5 and 6, and visits 7 and 8 were similar to visits 3 and 4 except that MMSE was performed at visit 5 and 7. Based on the experiences gathered in the feasibility study, 17 breaks were permitted throughout the recording periods where the participants were allowed to take out the ear-EEG. Emphasis was put on recordings during the night, so participants were encouraged to wear the ear-EEG especially during the night. HC only had a single recording session with ear-EEG. The program for the HC was similar to the program for DLB patients except for the fact that the FAQ IADL and NPI were not administered. A short questionnaire about the use of the ear-EEG was administered to DLB patients at visit 4, 6, and 8. See Supplementary Data S1." ;

Recently, studies have found that patients with AD have a higher rate of IED when measured with long-term EEG [6][7][8] and a study found improved cognition after administration of levetiracetam in patients with AD who had IED. 9 However, no studies have so far investigated the prevalence of IED using long-term EEG in patients with DLB. In mouse models of α-synucleinopathy, one study found a link between network hyperexcitability as detected by IED, occurring during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. 10 Although atrophy of the temporal lobes is generally not as pronounced in DLB as in AD, 11 one study has suggested that a higher density of Lewy bodies is present in the temporal lobes. 12 Furthermore, in Parkinson's disease visual hallucinations may be related to IED originating from the temporal lobes. 13 Because of the possible clinical relevance of detecting IED, there is a need for accessible and dependable EEG monitoring in an outpatient setting. One method is ear-EEG 14 where the EEG signals are recorded from electrodes placed within a customized earpiece inserted into each ear and is associated with little interference of everyday life. [14][15][16] Recently, ear-EEG has shown to be feasible for long-term outpatient ear-EEG monitoring in patients with AD 17 and has been shown to be able to detect IED in patients with temporal lobe seizures. 18 Because of the symptoms being associated with temporal lobe structures, it is plausible that ear-EEG can capture IED in patients with DLB. In the current study exploratory study, we investigated if IED as measured with ear-EEG occurs with a higher frequency in patients with DLB compared to healthy controls." ;

When comparing age, education, cognitive scores, and the length of ear-EEG recordings between DLB (at baseline) and HC, we performed two-sample t tests. The distribution of the data as well as the variance was checked. χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test (if one input variable being ≤5) was performed for comparing sex, the number of participants with EEG slowing, the number of participants with spike/sharp waves at baseline, and the number of spikes/night and spikes/day between DLB and HC. When comparing the number of spikes or sharp waves/24 hours (spike frequency) between HC, and DLB at baseline, we calculated the rate ratio using the function rateratio from the epitools toolbox. Spearman's correlation between the spike frequency across all recordings in DLB and cognitive tests was performed. Changes in spikes or sharp waves between visits were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed-effect model including visit number (categorical variable) and logtransformed the amount of pre-processed EEG (in minutes) as the offset variable with a person specific random intercept in a Poisson regression model using the lme4 package. Changes in MMSE over visits were analyzed using a linear mixed model including visit number (categorical) as fixed effect because a decrease was expected over time. An unstructured covariance pattern was used to account for repeated measurements on the same subjects with the LMMStar package.  A comparison of participant characteristics of the HC with and without epileptiform discharges was performed using two-sample Wilcoxon test (see Supplementary Data S1)." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "This is the first study to provide data on the prevalence of IED in patients with DLB using long-term EEG monitoring. At baseline, 80% of patients showed IED with a significantly increased risk ratio of 2.5 for spike frequency as compared to HC. Most IED occurred at night in patients with DLB. Considerable variability was observed between visits in patients with DLB. A significant negative correlation (ρ = À0.80) between MMSE and spike frequency was found in DLB. The data quality of the ear-EEG was of the same magnitude in DLB and HC, and participants experienced only mild adverse events related to the ear-EEG. This is the first study to investigate the prevalence of IED in patients with DLB. Multiple studies have found that a larger percentage of patients with AD without epilepsy have IED (22%-75%) on 24-hour EEG recordings as compared to HC. [6][7][8]21 In our study, there was no significant differences in the proportions of patients with DLB who had IED at baseline (80%) as compared to HC (46.7%), which we suspect might be because of the low sample size. That the majority of DLB patients had IED in our study was in contrast to no IED being found using short-term EEG recordings in the included DLB patients and that short-term conventional EEG recordings in a large mixed memory clinic cohort only found that 3% of participants had IED. 29 This is in line with studies showing an association between recording length and number of IED. 21,30 As the probability of detecting IED increases with the total observation time, long-term EEG recordings are important when investigating the use of antiepileptic medication in patients with DLB as to be able to measure a possible decrease in the occurrence of IED after antiseizure medication. The spike frequency was significantly higher in patients with DLB as compared to HC at baseline, 1867 which has also been found in patients with AD. [6][7][8]21 One explanation for the increased spike frequency could be depositions of α-synuclein, which has been shown to induce network excitability in transgenic mouse models 31 that can escalate into seizure activity. 32 In addition, one study found an association between the densities of Lewy bodies in the temporal lobes and visual hallucinations, 12 and visual hallucinations have been linked to IED in the temporal lobes in patients with Parkinson's disease. 13 However, because of a high frequency of amyloid deposition in DLB, 33,34 it is also possible that AD related pathology leads to IED in DLB patients (ie, that amyloid is the common denominator leading to IED) or that the neurodegenerative process per se leads to IED. However, studies in transgenic mouse models have found that α-synuclein aggregation alone is sufficient to cause network hyperexcitability. 10,31,32 It is also possible that more IED can be detected if measurements were made over the parietal or occipital cortex because of the location of neurodegeneration in patients with DLB. 11 A tendency toward more IED occurring at night was seen in patients with DLB (Fig. 2). In DLB, multiple studies have shown that REM sleep behavior disorder is common 35 and studies using polysomnography has shown sleep fragmentation and shortened REM time. 36 Because REM sleep has been shown to possibly inhibit IED 37,38 and this process becomes altered in patients with DLB, it is likely to worsen or possibly lead to IED during the neurodegenerative processes. This is in line with a study using mouse models of α-synucleinopathy, which found increasing IED during non-REM sleep. 10 Because of the small sample size, there is a need for a larger study to confirm the findings. Considerable variability between recordings was observed. It is possible that the variability is associated with cognitive fluctuations. A qualitative study suggested that fluctuation observed in DLB has a transient quality, which reflects an interruption of awareness. 39 Several theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism of fluctuations in patients with DLB. 40 One theory being atrophy of the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insular regions observed in patients with prodromal DLB, because these regions harbor neurons implicated in the integrity of attentional circuits. 41 Because of the location of the insular regions, it is plausible that the ear-EEG can capture IED originating from these areas. However, more studies are needed to understand if there is a link between fluctuations and IED in DLB. Our study has several limitations. First, the number of participants was low, which limits the generalizability of the study, and more studies are needed to understand the prevalence of spikes in patients with DLB. However, findings are in line with studies in AD, which have also shown increased epileptiform activity. We found a relatively high spike frequency in HC. This was surprising and may be because of the long recordings or undetected neurodegenerative pathology. Furthermore, no significant differences were found for the participant characteristics for HC with and without epileptiform discharges. Because of the low spatial resolution of ear-EEG, it is possible that false positive epileptiform discharges were annotated leading to an overestimation both in HC and DLB. Future studies should carry out studies on the validity of epileptiform discharges in ear-EEG as compared to scalp-EEG to directly compare epileptiform discharges as recorded by ear-EEG and scalp-EEG. Furthermore, we did not have multiple recordings in HC, which makes it difficult to understand if variability between recordings is seen in participants without a neurodegenerative disease. Here, we did not have any clinical scales for measuring fluctuations and could not directly investigate the link with IED. Another important aspect is the lack of characterization of sleep stages. However, automatic sleep staging tools for ear-EEG has been developed, 42 but validation in older cognitively healthy controls and/or patients with neurodegenerative diseases is needed. Furthermore, because of the low spatial resolution of the ear-EEG, it is possible that IED were missed because IED occur at areas associated with neurodegeneration in DLB. However, we were able to conduct long-term outpatient EEG recordings in patients with DLB, which showed significantly higher spike frequency as compared to HC." ;
