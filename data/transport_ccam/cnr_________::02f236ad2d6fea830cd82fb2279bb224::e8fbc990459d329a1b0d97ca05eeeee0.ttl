        nif:anchorOf              "Reducing emissions is a growing concern for cities, and it is crucial to estimate the impact of policies targeting vehicles to reduce their footprint on the city's environment. We investigate the impact of the vehicles' electrification on the total amount of emissions and the distribution of emissions across the roads. In particular, we study how the electrification of a certain share of vehicles would change the emissions on the three cities' roads. In this setting, even if a vehicle's electrification would change its driver's mobility behaviour, the vehicle would not create any emissions. We find that the electrification of just the top 1% of gross polluters would reduce emissions as much as electrifying 10% of random vehicles. In Figure 3, we show a case study for the entire city of Rome as well as a single neighbourhood to investigate the impact of massive electrification on emissions. We provide results for London and Florence in Supplementary Note 8. As the share of gross polluters that shift to electric engines grows, the impact on the roads in reducing emissions becomes more evident. In particular, if the top 10% of gross polluters shift to an electric engine, 107 roads have a significant reduction in the grams of CO 2 per meter (at least equal to 0.01 g/m), see Table 3 and Figure 3d. In contrast, if 10% of the vehicles that shift to electric engines are chosen at random, only 18 roads have a significant reduction of emissions (see Figure 3b). These results hold for both single neighbourhoods and the entire city (see Figure 3e,f for Rome and Supplementary Note 8 for London and Florence). The percentage reduction of the overall emissions grows almost linearly when the share of electric vehicles is chosen at random. In contrast, a Generalised Logistic Function (GLF, also known as Richard's curve [54,18]) approximates the growth rate when the gross polluters are electrified first. We use non-linear least squares to fit the GLF, , where α represents the upper asymptote, β the growth range, r the growth rate, and ν the slope of the curve. The model gives R 2 = 0.99 both for the selected neighbourhood (Figure 3e) and the whole city of Rome (Figure 3f). The estimated growth rate r of the curve is 4.84 × 10 −2 for the neighbourhood and 3.96 × 10 −2 for the entire city of Rome. Its slope ν is almost the same if we move from the neighbourhood to the entire city (−1.55 and −1.56, respectively). α and β are ≈ 100 and −1 for both the neighbourhood and the city. Similar results hold for Florence (Supplementary Figure 35b, Supplementary Table 14). In Greater London (Supplementary Figure 35a), the growth starts slowly (ν = −0.86): there are fewer vehicles with high emissions levels, and electrifying the most polluting vehicles is slightly less effective in reducing emissions than in the other two cities (Supplementary Table 14). Given the increasing importance of remote working, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic [65,44], we simulate the impact of a massive shift to remote working on reducing vehicles' emissions. Even if this working style may affect individual mobility patterns, we assume that it eliminates commuting trips. Indeed, if an individual works from home, the most straightforward implication is the removal of the commuting trips from their mobility habits. We identify the vehicles' home and work locations (see Methods) and study the emissions generated from their commuting patterns. We perform a simulation in which a growing share of these commuters become home workers, i.e., they do not travel anymore between their home and work locations. We find that emissions reduction is more effective when the home workers are gross polluters. In this case, remote working for the top 1% gross polluters leads to the same reduction reached if they were ≈ 4% random vehicles (see Supplementary Figure 36). Again, a GLF well fits emissions reduction when the gross polluters become home workers. In particular, we obtain estimates for ν (the slope of the curve) that are similar for Rome and Florence (−1.30 and −1.35, respectively) and lower for London (−0.72); see Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Figure 36 for details. Overall, these results demonstrate that targeting specific profiles of vehicles can significantly improve emission reduction policies." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "Estimating air pollutants' distribution over space and time is a significant challenge concerning climate change and human health. In urban environments, air pollution generated from vehicles' emissions has become more and more evident, to the point that a temporary interruption of regular traffic during the COVID-19's lockdown resulted in a tremendous decrease in CO 2 emission [63,36,27,40]. Even if this brief period's impact on the epochal challenge of climate change is negligible [20], it helps outline the impact of the emissions related to transportation on our everyday life. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from this sector have doubled since 1970, and, in 2016, 11.9% of global GHG emissions were from road transport (60% of which was from passenger travel) [31,55]. Moreover, the transport sector emits non-CO 2 pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, ozone, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, which play a fundamental role in changing climate and are dangerous for human health [31]. Among the Sustainable Development Goals to be reached by 2030 [62], the United Nations pose an urgent call for action to reduce \"the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, paying particular attention to air quality\" [62]. In this regard, measuring the vehicles' emissions is primary in designing policies to reduce transportation emissions. Based on the data at disposal, existing methods to quantify vehicles' emissions range between two extremes. On the one hand, some approaches rely on measurements performed on small samples of vehicles (usually less than 10) but with high spatio-temporal resolutions, such as those coming from particulate sensors [16] or portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) [12,42]. These sensors measure emissions in real-world driving conditions, producing accurate estimates but hardly generalisable patterns due to the limited sample size. For example, two studies [42,12] analyse emissions from PEMS of one and three light-duty vehicles, finding that the highest emissions are associated with the urban part of the route, flat roads, and low speed. On the other hand, some studies cover a region's almost entire fleet, such as those using odometer readings from annual safety inspections. These data describe each vehicle's age, fuel type, engine volume, and mileage, used in macroscopic models to estimate annual emissions. For example, two studies [10,30] use odometer readings to compute mean annual emissions for UK postcode areas and explore the built-environment effects (e.g., work accessibility) on the vehicles' annual miles travelled in Boston. Unfortunately, odometer readings miss critical information such as instantaneous speed and acceleration [33,13,19,69], making it challenging to track emissions over time and map them to suburban areas. GPS traces generated by in-vehicle devices stand as a trade-off between these two extremes. Depending on the provider's market penetration, they can cover a representative fraction of the vehicle fleet [48] and allow computing instantaneous speed and acceleration, which are used within microscopic models to obtain emissions estimates in high spatio-temporal resolution. GPS traces describe human mobility in great detail [50,22,41,3] and offer an unprecedented tool to implement strategies such as reducing congestion, improving vehicle efficiency, and shifting to lower-carbon options [15,43,58,8,32,38,56]. Given these peculiarities, several studies use GPS traces to analyse the vehicles' emissions at different spatio-temporal scales [45,39], investigate the relationship between emissions and the urban environment [53], vehicle miles travelled and fuel consumption [66], or trip rates and travel mode choice [9]. Other studies concentrate on congestion-related emissions [23] or braking [11], emissions associated with ride-hailing [59] and bus stops' positioning [68], the impact of urban policies [52], methods for emission modelling [70,2], and air quality monitoring [16]. Despite the depicted variety of literature, it remains unclear what statistical patterns characterise the distribution of emissions per vehicle and road, how these distributions change in time and space, and how we can exploit this information to simulate emission reduction scenarios. For example, although it is reported that the distribution of emissions from on-road remote sensing sites across the vehicles is skewed [25,7,28], this finding has been questioned given the inherent limitations of this type of measurement [29]. This paper analyses the estimated emissions of several air pollutants from thousands of private vehicles moving in different European cities. We use trajectories produced by onboard GPS devices to compute the vehicles' emissions and match the obtained emissions to the cities' road networks. We then study how the emissions distribute across vehicles and roads to discover the statistical patterns that characterise emissions and investigate the relationships between emissions, human mobility, and the road network's characteristics. Finally, we simulate two emission reduction scenarios in which a share of vehicles become zero-emissions or limit their mobility, identifying strategies to drastically reduce emissions over a city while minimising the share of vehicles targeted. Our framework, which applies to any city provided the availability of vehicles' GPS trajectories and road networks data, may represent practical support for decision-makers to implement strategies to reduce emissions, improve citizens' well-being and design more sustainable cities [4,34,64]." ;

For example, although it is reported that the distribution of emissions from on-road remote sensing sites across the vehicles is skewed [25,7,28], this finding has been questioned given the inherent limitations of this type of measurement [29]. This paper analyses the estimated emissions of several air pollutants from thousands of private vehicles moving in different European cities. We use trajectories produced by onboard GPS devices to compute the vehicles' emissions and match the obtained emissions to the cities' road networks. We then study how the emissions distribute across vehicles and roads to discover the statistical patterns that characterise emissions and investigate the relationships between emissions, human mobility, and the road network's characteristics. Finally, we simulate two emission reduction scenarios in which a share of vehicles become zero-emissions or limit their mobility, identifying strategies to drastically reduce emissions over a city while minimising the share of vehicles targeted. Our framework, which applies to any city provided the availability of vehicles' GPS trajectories and road networks data, may represent practical support for decision-makers to implement strategies to reduce emissions, improve citizens' well-being and design more sustainable cities [4,34,64].  We use anonymous GPS trajectories describing 423,018 trips from 16,715 private light-duty vehicles moving in Greater London, Rome, and Florence throughout January 2017 (see Table 1). The spatio-temporal patterns of the vehicles' trajectories are stable across the cities and the seasons of the year (see Supplementary Note 1). The trajectories are produced by onboard GPS devices, which automatically turn on when the vehicle starts, transmitting a point every minute to the server via a GPRS connection [48,50,22]. When the vehicle stops, no points are logged or sent. The GPS traces are collected by a company that provides a data collection service for insurance companies. The market penetration of this service is variable, but, in general, it covers at least 2% of the total registered vehicles, and it is representative of the overall amount of vehicles circulating in a city [48]. Figure 1a shows a sample of trajectories for 20 vehicles in Rome. We define a methodological framework to compute vehicles' emissions from their raw GPS trajectories (see Supplementary Figure 4). We filter the GPS trajectories so that the time between consecutive points is lower than a certain threshold (see Methods and Supplementary Note 2). For each vehicle, we estimate the instantaneous speed and acceleration in each point of its trajectory and filter out points with unrealistic values (see Methods and Figure 1b). We use a Nearest-Neighbour algorithm to assign the points to the city's roads based on road networks downloaded from OpenStreetMap (see Methods). The three cities are heterogeneous in their road networks: Rome is large but with the sparsest network; London is huge but with the densest network; Florence is small (≈ 1/12 of Rome and ≈ 1/15 of London in terms of land area) but with a dense road network (see Supplementary Note 3 for details). We use a microscopic emissions model [45] that uses speed, acceleration, and fuel type to estimate the vehicles' instantaneous emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) (see Methods). Finally, we compute each vehicle's overall emissions as the sum of all its instantaneous emissions during the study period. Analogously, we compute the overall amount of air pollutants on each road by summing up all the instantaneous emissions from any vehicle passing through that road during the same period (Figure 1c). We find that, for all three cities, emissions distribute across vehicles in a heterogeneous way: a few vehicles, that we call gross polluters, are responsible for a tremendous amount of emissions. At the same time, most vehicles emit significantly less (Figure 2). The distribution of emissions per vehicle is associated with a Gini coefficient higher than 0.55, for all the cities and pollutants (see Supplementary Note 4). In line with previous studies [25,7,28], we find that the top 10% of gross polluters in Florence, Rome, and London are responsible for 47.5%, 50.5%, and 38.5% of the total CO 2 emitted during the month, respectively. The distributions of CO 2 emissions per vehicle of Rome and Florence are well approximated by a truncated power law p(x) ∝ x −α e −λx , with α = 1.13, λ = 1.04 × 10 −3 (Rome, Figure 2e), and α = 2.12, λ = 1.45 × 10 −3 (Florence, Figure 2h). Similarly, London's distribution is well approximated by a stretched exponential p(x) ∝ x β−1 e −λx β , with parameters λ = 5.7 × 10 −4 and β = 1.26 (Figure 2b). These results are consistent with those we find for the other three pollutants (NO x , PM, VOC): a truncated power-law well  approximates the distribution for Rome and Florence, and a stretched exponential well approximates that for London (see Supplementary Notes 4 and 5 for details). The picture is similar when considering the distribution of emissions per road: a few grossly polluted roads suffer from a significant quantity of emissions, most of them suffer significantly fewer emissions. This distribution is associated with a Gini coefficient higher than 0.64 (see Supplementary Note 4) for all the cities and pollutants, and it is well approximated by a truncated power law, with exponents α = 1.55 and λ = 1.08 × 10 −4 (Rome, Figure 2f), α = 1.52 and λ = 1.30 × 10 −4 (Florence, Figure 2i), α = 2.59 and λ = 2.88 × 10 −4 (London, Figure 2c). London has both the exponents α and λ significantly higher than Rome and Florence, denoting a fairer distribution of the emissions per road (see Supplementary Figure 17). In Florence and Rome, the top 10% of grossly polluted roads are associated with more than 90% of the CO 2 emitted during the period. In London, this quantity is lower (56.7%) but still above half of the city's total emissions of CO 2 . Again, we find similar results for the other pollutants (see Supplementary Note 4). The above results hold when changing the year's season (see Supplementary Note 1). Also, the sample size of the dataset and the choice of the filtering parameter θ do not affect the significance of our results: the shape of the distributions holds even if we significantly reduce the sample size or change θ (see Supplementary Note 6). To investigate the relationship between a vehicle's emissions and mobility patterns, we compute Spearman's correlation coefficient between the emissions and four mobility quantities (see Methods). They are the radius of gyration, indicating Figure 2: Distributions of emissions. The amount of CO 2 emissions (expressed as grams per meter of road emitted during January 2017) on the road networks of Greater London (a), Rome (d), and Florence (g). Roads are coloured in a gradient from yellow (low emission) to red (high emission). Panels (b), (e), and (h) show in log-log scale the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF, black dots) of the CO 2 emissions per vehicle, together with the best fit (red curve) in Greater London, Rome, and Florence, respectively. Panels (c), (f), and (i) show the CCDF (black dots) of the CO 2 emissions per road, together with the best fit (red curve), in Greater London, Rome, and Florence, respectively. the characteristic distance travelled by an individual [24,49]; the mobility entropy [57,17,51], characterising the predictability of their visitation patterns; and the total travel time of the vehicles, a principal factor governing emissions. The travel time shows positive correlations whose strength varies little from city to city. The radius correlates positively with the vehicle's emissions, while the entropy correlates negatively. In London, the travel time has a strong positive correlation (0.98) with the emissions (see Table 2), the radius has an almost null correlation (0.09), and the entropy has a strong negative correlation (−0.72). In Rome, the strength of the correlation with the travel time is high (0.8), and the radius (0.58) and the entropy (−0.54) are respectively positively and negatively correlated with the emissions. In Florence, the correlation coefficient of the travel time decreases (0.48), and those of the radius and entropy show similar behaviour as in Rome: the first is positive (0.30), the second is negative (−0.29). As one could expect, the more a vehicle travels, the more emissions it produces. However, vehicles with more regular and predictable behaviour generate the highest emissions, not those with more erratic behaviour. Indeed, mobility entropy is low when a vehicle performs a high number of recurring trips, indicating predictable travelling patterns. In contrast, it is high when the vehicle performs trips from various origins and destinations, denoting a more unpredictable travelling behaviour. The observed negative correlations suggest that gross polluters are more regular and predictable than low-emitting vehicles. To deepen these relationships, we use a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) [26] to express the emissions as a non-linear combination of the three mobility measures (see Supplementary Note 7). We find that the radius and the entropy contribute in an opposite way to determining a vehicle's emissions. On the one hand, for Rome and Florence, the greater a vehicle's radius of gyration, the greater its emissions (see Supplementary Figures 29 and 30). For London, the radius of gyration's marginal contribution to the emissions is constant for values > 7 km (see Supplementary Figure 28). On the other hand, for Rome and Florence, the greater a vehicle's entropy, the lower its emissions (Supplementary Figures 29 and 30). For London, the negative marginal contribution of the entropy to the emissions only holds for entropy > 0.7 (see Supplementary Figure 29). We also perform a cluster analysis to group the vehicles based on their radius of gyration, mobility entropy and travel time. We find two clusters, namely the predictable and the erratic drivers, and find that the former emits typically more than the latter (see Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Figure 31). The interpretation of these results would imply further analyses involving additional data providing information about the motivations behind each vehicle's trip (e.g., drivers' mobility diaries). For example, the erratic vehicles could emit less because they are primarily used for sporadic excursions towards unknown locations. In contrast, predictable drivers could be forced to use private vehicles because they live or work in neighbourhoods poorly served by public transportation. Also, the heterogeneity in emissions' distributions could be related to socio-economic inequalities and the centre-periphery divide. For example, in Rome, \"new low-density settlements often take on the character of sprawl and rely exclusively on private transportation\" [37]. We also investigate the relationship between the emissions suffered by a road and network features such as the road length and the betweenness centrality of the edge representing the road. The betweenness centrality is based on how frequently a road falls on the shortest paths connecting two crossroads (see Methods). Therefore, a road with a high centrality is more likely to be crossed. We find a positive correlation between the betweenness centrality and the emissions in the roads for all three cities (see Table 2). This result confirms that our emissions estimates are consistent with the roads' characteristics, as roads central in the network are more likely to host greater emissions. Similarly, we find a positive correlation with the road length (see Table 2), as longer roads capture more points and thus more emissions. Similar results hold for the emissions of the other three pollutants in all the three cities (see Supplementary Note 7). Figure 2a,d,g shows the entire road networks of Greater London, Rome, and Florence, respectively, with the emissions on each road, normalised by the length of the road to highlight the differences between the roads better. Reducing emissions is a growing concern for cities, and it is crucial to estimate the impact of policies targeting vehicles to reduce their footprint on the city's environment. We investigate the impact of the vehicles' electrification on the total amount of emissions and the distribution of emissions across the roads. In particular, we study how the electrification of a certain share of vehicles would change the emissions on the three cities' roads. In this setting, even if a vehicle's electrification would change its driver's mobility behaviour, the vehicle would not create any emissions. We find that the electrification of just the top 1% of gross polluters would reduce emissions as much as electrifying 10% of random vehicles. In Figure 3, we show a case study for the entire city of Rome as well as a single neighbourhood to investigate the impact of massive electrification on emissions. We provide results for London and Florence in Supplementary Note 8. As the share of gross polluters that shift to electric engines grows, the impact on the roads in reducing emissions becomes more evident. In particular, if the top 10% of gross polluters shift to an electric engine, 107 roads have a significant reduction in the grams of CO 2 per meter (at least equal to 0.01 g/m), see Table 3 and Figure 3d. In contrast, if 10% of the vehicles that shift to electric engines are chosen at random, only 18 roads have a significant reduction of emissions (see Figure 3b). These results hold for both single neighbourhoods and the entire city (see Figure 3e,f for Rome and Supplementary Note 8 for London and Florence). The percentage reduction of the overall emissions grows almost linearly when the share of electric vehicles is chosen at random. In contrast, a Generalised Logistic Function (GLF, also known as Richard's curve [54,18]) approximates the growth rate when the gross polluters are electrified first. We use non-linear least squares to fit the GLF, , where α represents the upper asymptote, β the growth range, r the growth rate, and ν the slope of the curve. The model gives R 2 = 0.99 both for the selected neighbourhood (Figure 3e) and the whole city of Rome (Figure 3f). The estimated growth rate r of the curve is 4.84 × 10 −2 for the neighbourhood and 3.96 × 10 −2 for the entire city of Rome. Its slope ν is almost the same if we move from the neighbourhood to the entire city (−1.55 and −1.56, respectively). α and β are ≈ 100 and −1 for both the neighbourhood and the city. Similar results hold for Florence (Supplementary Figure 35b, Supplementary Table 14). In Greater London (Supplementary Figure 35a), the growth starts slowly (ν = −0.86): there are fewer vehicles with high emissions levels, and electrifying the most polluting vehicles is slightly less effective in reducing emissions than in the other two cities (Supplementary Table 14). Given the increasing importance of remote working, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic [65,44], we simulate the impact of a massive shift to remote working on reducing vehicles' emissions. Even if this working style may affect individual mobility patterns, we assume that it eliminates commuting trips. Indeed, if an individual works from home, the most straightforward implication is the removal of the commuting trips from their mobility habits. We identify the vehicles' home and work locations (see Methods) and study the emissions generated from their commuting patterns. We perform a simulation in which a growing share of these commuters become home workers, i.e., they do not travel anymore between their home and work locations. We find that emissions reduction is more effective when the home workers are gross polluters. In this case, remote working for the top 1% gross polluters leads to the same reduction reached if they were ≈ 4% random vehicles (see Supplementary Figure 36). Again, a GLF well fits emissions reduction when the gross polluters become home workers. In particular, we obtain estimates for ν (the slope of the curve) that are similar for Rome and Florence (−1.30 and −1.35, respectively) and lower for London (−0.72); see Supplementary Note 8 and Supplementary Figure 36 for details. Overall, these results demonstrate that targeting specific profiles of vehicles can significantly improve emission reduction policies. Using GPS data to estimate the emissions from thousands of vehicles in three European cities with different sizes and characteristics, we show the existence of gross polluters, i.e., vehicles responsible for the greatest quantity of emissions. The existence of gross polluters has been reported in previous studies using measurements from on-road remote sensing sites [25,7,28]. Nevertheless, these studies have been questioned because measurements from on-road sites cannot represent a vehicle's overall emission level [29]. Our study contributes to reshaping this discussion since our findings are based on a microscopic emission model that captures the vehicles' instantaneous emissions in great detail. We add new elements to this debate, discovering that gross polluters exist in different cities and for different pollutants (CO 2 , NO x , PM, VOC) and reporting the existence of grossly polluted roads that suffer the greatest amount of emissions. The heterogeneous patterns governing the distribution of emissions across vehicles and roads are well approximated by heavy-tailed distributions, with exponents that vary from city to city and from pollutant to pollutant. These peculiar exponents may depend on the characteristics of the city's road network and people's commuting behaviour. For example, London has a vast and dense road network, and people use private vehicles less intensively [61] than in Rome and Florence. Thus, one can argue that mobility behaviour in London leads to a distribution of emissions per vehicle that is fairer than people's behaviour in Rome, which is characterised by a vast and sparse road network and intensive use of private vehicles [21]. Our study can be reproduced with any city provided the availability of vehicles' GPS trajectories and road networks data and may help find more effective strategies to reduce emissions. For example, our study demonstrates that blocking the circulation based on a non-informed choice (e.g., blocking vehicles with odd or even number plates) has less impact on reducing emissions than identifying and targeting a small share of gross polluters. Moreover, we provide a precise model to estimate the overall reduction of emissions generated by the electrification of a particular share of vehicles or by reducing the number of commuting patterns travelled by the vehicles (e.g., caused by a transition to the home working of their drivers). There are several directions in which this study can be extended. For example, since it focuses on light-duty vehicles, all the results we show are valid for this fleet of vehicles only. Although they are the vast majority of the vehicles circulating in a city, we are aware that the absence of other vehicles such as heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., buses, trucks) generates an incomplete mosaic of the emissions within the urban environment. We, therefore, hope for a more comprehensive study that may include different types of vehicles. Also, our analysis can be extended by investigating how the emission patterns change between weekdays and weekends or weather conditions and considering more sophisticated simulation scenarios. For example, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of policies that aim to improve walking, transit, or cycling on the distribution of emissions, the number of gross polluters, and grossly polluted roads. Finally, the relation between the vehicles' emissions and mobility patterns may be examined more deeply to investigate whether the observed heterogeneous distributions originate from other inequalities (e.g., socio-economic inequalities and centre-periphery divide). Meanwhile, our study may shape the discussion on measuring emissions with digital data and how to use such measurements to simulate emission reduction scenarios. If we learn how to use such a resource, we have the potential of monitoring in real-time the level of emission in our urban environments and taking immediate, informed actions when they overcome a certain tolerance threshold. This fact is crucial because policymakers' decisions depend on what we measure, how good our measurements are, and how promptly we react to these measurements. Data Filtering. In our GPS dataset, each trajectory point is associated with a vehicle identifier, a trajectory identifier, a timestamp, and a latitude/longitude pair. The sampling rate of the trajectory points may affect the estimate of instantaneous speed and acceleration. Since the mean time interval between trajectory points varies from city to city (it is about one minute for London and four minutes for Rome and Florence, see Table 1), we perform a pre-processing step to align them. For each trajectory, we retain only those sub-trajectories (i.e., disjoint subsets of points) that satisfy two constraints: (i) there are at least two points, and (ii) the time interval between consecutive points is less than θ = 120 seconds. The filtering step causes a drop in the number of points and, by consequence, of vehicles. We analyse the trends of both the number of vehicles and points resulting from the filtering step varying the filtering parameter θ from 1 second to 300 seconds (see Supplementary Note 1). By choosing θ = 120 seconds, we lose 53.5% of points in Rome, 1.4% in London, and 70.4% in Florence. Consequently, we discard 1.3% of vehicles in Rome, 0.9% in London, and 6.5% in Florence (see Table 1). Different works use different values for θ (e.g., the time interval between the points is set to 1 second [11], 3 seconds [59], 5 seconds [45], 5 to 50 seconds [39]). Our choice derives from our data sampling rate and is a trade-off between the reliability of the results and the data coverage. As the last step, we compute, for each vehicle, the speed and acceleration in each point, and retain only points whose speed is lower than 300 km/h and whose acceleration is in the range [−10, +10] m/s 2 (as suggested by Nyhan et al. [45]). Road network and GPS points snapping. The road network of each city is extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) [46], a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world and provide the geodata underlying the map. In particular, the road network is provided as a multigraph G = (V, E), with V being the set of nodes v and E being the multiset of edges e, in which the edges represent public roads accessible to vehicles (including service roads). Each edge e ∈ E is a pair of two identifiers, indicating the starting and ending OSM nodes, plus a key that discriminates between parallel edges (if present). Moreover, it carries some information about the road it represents, such as its name, length, and type (e.g., whether it is a motorway or residential street). In this context, we call crossroads the nodes v ∈ V that have at least two roads (i.e. edges e ∈ E) incident on them. To download, compute statistics, and visualise the road networks, we conceived methods based on the Python library OSMnx [5]. Our matching step consists of a ball tree Nearest-Neighbour algorithm that assigns each point of a GPS trajectory to its nearest edge in the road network. This point snapping step allows us to assign the vehicles' emissions to the roads onto which they are produced (see Figure 1c). Note that the Nearest-Neighbour algorithm used does not affect the quality of the emissions estimated with the microscopic model. Indeed, the instantaneous emissions are computed based on the points' speed and acceleration computed from the GPS data (not matched yet with the road network). Moreover, our GPS data come with a quality index that ranges from 1 to 3 and indicates the precision of each GPS point's location. A point's maximum quality (i.e., index = 3) indicates that at least four satellites' signals received by the GPS device are used for the trilateration of the point's location. Our study only uses the points with the highest quality (i.e., index = 3). Given this accuracy in the points' locations, the reconciliation problem is straightforward [67], and we assign the location obtained from the GPS receiver to the nearest edge in the network. Computing emissions. We implement a microscopic emissions model [45] to compute the instantaneous emissions associated with each trajectory point p. We denote the quantity of pollutant j ∈ {CO 2 , NO x , PM, VOC} emitted at point p from vehicle u as E j,u p and the instantaneous speed and acceleration of the vehicle in p as v p and a p , respectively. Information about its engine type (whether it is petrol, diesel, or LPG) is available for each vehicle. This information determines, together with the type of pollutant, the emission factors f i . We use the following equation to compute the instantaneous emissions E j,u p of pollutant j from vehicle u in point p: where for NO x and VOC emissions the factors f 1 , ..., f 6 change with acceleration (based on whether a p ≥ −0.5 m/s 2 or a p < −0.5 m/s 2 ). In Supplementary Table 16, we show the value of factors f 1 , . . . , f 6 varying the vehicle's type and acceleration. Mobility measures and roads' centrality. We use four quantities to describe the mobility of a vehicle u: • the radius of gyration [24,50,48]  , where P is the set of n points recorded for u, r i (u) indicates the coordinates of trajectory point i ∈ P , r cm (u) is the centre of mass of u, and dist the haversine distance between two points on earth; • the temporal-uncorrelated entropy [57,17,51] S(u) = − Nu i=1 p u (i) log 2 p u (i), where N u is the number of distinct locations visited by u, and p u (i) is the probability that u visits location i; • the travel time of u, computed as the sum of all the travel times of its trajectories. We measure the centrality of a road, a proxy of its traffic volume in the city, as its betweenness centrality. In network science, the betweenness centrality of an edge e (i.e., a road in our case) is defined as C b (e) = s,t∈V σ(s,t|e) σ(s,t) , where V is the set of nodes in the network, σ(s, t) is the number of shortest paths between s and t, and σ(s, t|e) is the number of those shortest paths passing through edge e. Home and work locations. The first step when identifying an individual's home and work locations is the selection of the starting and ending points of their trajectories [47]. The position of the starting (or ending) points of the trajectories that start from (or end to) the same semantic location may not coincide. This may happen because: (a) a driver can park the vehicle within a certain radius from the location; (b) since the first point sent by the GPS device often lacks precision and is discarded, the second point sent is taken as the starting point of the trajectory. For the above reason, we spatially cluster these points within a radius of 250 meters and take the centroid of each cluster as the vehicle's stop location. To identify a vehicle's home and work locations, we use a principle commonly adopted in the literature [47]: the home location is the stop location corresponding to the most frequent cluster; the work location is the stop location corresponding to the second most frequent cluster. We discard the vehicles for which it is impossible to identify the most frequent stop location(s) (for example, the vehicle visited each location only once). We successfully identify home and work locations for 55%, 31%, and 16% of the vehicles moving in London, Rome, and Florence, respectively. There are two main reasons we cannot identify the home and work locations of many vehicles in Florence. First, the average number of trajectories per vehicle (10.7) is much lower than in the other two cities (27.6 in Rome and 43 in London) (see Table 1). The fewer trajectories a vehicle has, the more difficult it is to identify its home and work locations. Second, while a relatively small city, Florence is an essential hub for the surroundings. Thus, many users could live outside the city. Moreover, even if they live inside the city, given various restricted traffic areas in the city's historic centre, many could reach the workplace by public transportation or walking. This leads to a low number of commuting trajectories inside the city. 1.  7. 4,782 vehicles 51,000 trips 291,598 points Select sub-trajectories (i) composed by at least two points, (ii) whose time distance between consecutive points is smaller than 120 seconds.

Figure 13: Empirical Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the emissions per vehicle. For each pollutant and city, we show the empirical CCDF of the data. For each quantity x emitted by a vehicle, the CCDF is the probability of getting a vehicle that emitted more than x. The scale is logarithmic in both the axes. The shape of the distribution is similar across the cities and air pollutants. Figure 14: Empirical Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the emissions per road.

The maximum share of vehicles that stop commuting in our simulation changes with the city: it is 31% for Rome, 16% for Florence, and 55% for London, as these are the percentages of vehicles for which we can identify both the home and work locations and, thus, the commuting trajectories. The black dashed curve represents the case in which the vehicles that stop commuting are chosen at random. The blue solid curve represents the case in which the vehicles that stop commuting are chosen from the most polluting to the least polluting, and the dotted red curve is its Generalised Logistic Function (Richard's curve) fit: f (x) = α (1+βe −rx ) 1/ν , where α represents the upper asymptote, β the growth range, r the growth rate, and ν the slope of the curve.

        nif:anchorOf              "To investigate the relationship between a vehicle's emissions and mobility patterns, we compute Spearman's correlation coefficient between the emissions and four mobility quantities (see Methods). They are the radius of gyration, indicating Figure 2: Distributions of emissions. The amount of CO 2 emissions (expressed as grams per meter of road emitted during January 2017) on the road networks of Greater London (a), Rome (d), and Florence (g). Roads are coloured in a gradient from yellow (low emission) to red (high emission). Panels (b), (e), and (h) show in log-log scale the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF, black dots) of the CO 2 emissions per vehicle, together with the best fit (red curve) in Greater London, Rome, and Florence, respectively. Panels (c), (f), and (i) show the CCDF (black dots) of the CO 2 emissions per road, together with the best fit (red curve), in Greater London, Rome, and Florence, respectively. the characteristic distance travelled by an individual [24,49]; the mobility entropy [57,17,51], characterising the predictability of their visitation patterns; and the total travel time of the vehicles, a principal factor governing emissions. The travel time shows positive correlations whose strength varies little from city to city. The radius correlates positively with the vehicle's emissions, while the entropy correlates negatively. In London, the travel time has a strong positive correlation (0.98) with the emissions (see Table 2), the radius has an almost null correlation (0.09), and the entropy has a strong negative correlation (−0.72). In Rome, the strength of the correlation with the travel time is high (0.8), and the radius (0.58) and the entropy (−0.54) are respectively positively and negatively correlated with the emissions. In Florence, the correlation coefficient of the travel time decreases (0.48), and those of the radius and entropy show similar behaviour as in Rome: the first is positive (0.30), the second is negative (−0.29). As one could expect, the more a vehicle travels, the more emissions it produces. However, vehicles with more regular and predictable behaviour generate the highest emissions, not those with more erratic behaviour. Indeed, mobility entropy is low when a vehicle performs a high number of recurring trips, indicating predictable travelling patterns. In contrast, it is high when the vehicle performs trips from various origins and destinations, denoting a more unpredictable travelling behaviour. The observed negative correlations suggest that gross polluters are more regular and predictable than low-emitting vehicles. To deepen these relationships, we use a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) [26] to express the emissions as a non-linear combination of the three mobility measures (see Supplementary Note 7). We find that the radius and the entropy contribute in an opposite way to determining a vehicle's emissions. On the one hand, for Rome and Florence, the greater a vehicle's radius of gyration, the greater its emissions (see Supplementary Figures 29 and 30). For London, the radius of gyration's marginal contribution to the emissions is constant for values > 7 km (see Supplementary Figure 28). On the other hand, for Rome and Florence, the greater a vehicle's entropy, the lower its emissions (Supplementary Figures 29 and 30). For London, the negative marginal contribution of the entropy to the emissions only holds for entropy > 0.7 (see Supplementary Figure 29). We also perform a cluster analysis to group the vehicles based on their radius of gyration, mobility entropy and travel time. We find two clusters, namely the predictable and the erratic drivers, and find that the former emits typically more than the latter (see Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Figure 31). The interpretation of these results would imply further analyses involving additional data providing information about the motivations behind each vehicle's trip (e.g., drivers' mobility diaries). For example, the erratic vehicles could emit less because they are primarily used for sporadic excursions towards unknown locations. In contrast, predictable drivers could be forced to use private vehicles because they live or work in neighbourhoods poorly served by public transportation. Also, the heterogeneity in emissions' distributions could be related to socio-economic inequalities and the centre-periphery divide. For example, in Rome, \"new low-density settlements often take on the character of sprawl and rely exclusively on private transportation\" [37]. We also investigate the relationship between the emissions suffered by a road and network features such as the road length and the betweenness centrality of the edge representing the road. The betweenness centrality is based on how frequently a road falls on the shortest paths connecting two crossroads (see Methods). Therefore, a road with a high centrality is more likely to be crossed. We find a positive correlation between the betweenness centrality and the emissions in the roads for all three cities (see Table 2). This result confirms that our emissions estimates are consistent with the roads' characteristics, as roads central in the network are more likely to host greater emissions. Similarly, we find a positive correlation with the road length (see Table 2), as longer roads capture more points and thus more emissions. Similar results hold for the emissions of the other three pollutants in all the three cities (see Supplementary Note 7). Figure 2a,d,g shows the entire road networks of Greater London, Rome, and Florence, respectively, with the emissions on each road, normalised by the length of the road to highlight the differences between the roads better." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "We find that, for all three cities, emissions distribute across vehicles in a heterogeneous way: a few vehicles, that we call gross polluters, are responsible for a tremendous amount of emissions. At the same time, most vehicles emit significantly less (Figure 2). The distribution of emissions per vehicle is associated with a Gini coefficient higher than 0.55, for all the cities and pollutants (see Supplementary Note 4). In line with previous studies [25,7,28], we find that the top 10% of gross polluters in Florence, Rome, and London are responsible for 47.5%, 50.5%, and 38.5% of the total CO 2 emitted during the month, respectively. The distributions of CO 2 emissions per vehicle of Rome and Florence are well approximated by a truncated power law p(x) ∝ x −α e −λx , with α = 1.13, λ = 1.04 × 10 −3 (Rome, Figure 2e), and α = 2.12, λ = 1.45 × 10 −3 (Florence, Figure 2h). Similarly, London's distribution is well approximated by a stretched exponential p(x) ∝ x β−1 e −λx β , with parameters λ = 5.7 × 10 −4 and β = 1.26 (Figure 2b). These results are consistent with those we find for the other three pollutants (NO x , PM, VOC): a truncated power-law well  approximates the distribution for Rome and Florence, and a stretched exponential well approximates that for London (see Supplementary Notes 4 and 5 for details). The picture is similar when considering the distribution of emissions per road: a few grossly polluted roads suffer from a significant quantity of emissions, most of them suffer significantly fewer emissions. This distribution is associated with a Gini coefficient higher than 0.64 (see Supplementary Note 4) for all the cities and pollutants, and it is well approximated by a truncated power law, with exponents α = 1.55 and λ = 1.08 × 10 −4 (Rome, Figure 2f), α = 1.52 and λ = 1.30 × 10 −4 (Florence, Figure 2i), α = 2.59 and λ = 2.88 × 10 −4 (London, Figure 2c). London has both the exponents α and λ significantly higher than Rome and Florence, denoting a fairer distribution of the emissions per road (see Supplementary Figure 17). In Florence and Rome, the top 10% of grossly polluted roads are associated with more than 90% of the CO 2 emitted during the period. In London, this quantity is lower (56.7%) but still above half of the city's total emissions of CO 2 . Again, we find similar results for the other pollutants (see Supplementary Note 4). The above results hold when changing the year's season (see Supplementary Note 1). Also, the sample size of the dataset and the choice of the filtering parameter θ do not affect the significance of our results: the shape of the distributions holds even if we significantly reduce the sample size or change θ (see Supplementary Note 6)." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "Using GPS data to estimate the emissions from thousands of vehicles in three European cities with different sizes and characteristics, we show the existence of gross polluters, i.e., vehicles responsible for the greatest quantity of emissions. The existence of gross polluters has been reported in previous studies using measurements from on-road remote sensing sites [25,7,28]. Nevertheless, these studies have been questioned because measurements from on-road sites cannot represent a vehicle's overall emission level [29]. Our study contributes to reshaping this discussion since our findings are based on a microscopic emission model that captures the vehicles' instantaneous emissions in great detail. We add new elements to this debate, discovering that gross polluters exist in different cities and for different pollutants (CO 2 , NO x , PM, VOC) and reporting the existence of grossly polluted roads that suffer the greatest amount of emissions. The heterogeneous patterns governing the distribution of emissions across vehicles and roads are well approximated by heavy-tailed distributions, with exponents that vary from city to city and from pollutant to pollutant. These peculiar exponents may depend on the characteristics of the city's road network and people's commuting behaviour. For example, London has a vast and dense road network, and people use private vehicles less intensively [61] than in Rome and Florence. Thus, one can argue that mobility behaviour in London leads to a distribution of emissions per vehicle that is fairer than people's behaviour in Rome, which is characterised by a vast and sparse road network and intensive use of private vehicles [21]. Our study can be reproduced with any city provided the availability of vehicles' GPS trajectories and road networks data and may help find more effective strategies to reduce emissions. For example, our study demonstrates that blocking the circulation based on a non-informed choice (e.g., blocking vehicles with odd or even number plates) has less impact on reducing emissions than identifying and targeting a small share of gross polluters. Moreover, we provide a precise model to estimate the overall reduction of emissions generated by the electrification of a particular share of vehicles or by reducing the number of commuting patterns travelled by the vehicles (e.g., caused by a transition to the home working of their drivers). There are several directions in which this study can be extended. For example, since it focuses on light-duty vehicles, all the results we show are valid for this fleet of vehicles only. Although they are the vast majority of the vehicles circulating in a city, we are aware that the absence of other vehicles such as heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., buses, trucks) generates an incomplete mosaic of the emissions within the urban environment. We, therefore, hope for a more comprehensive study that may include different types of vehicles. Also, our analysis can be extended by investigating how the emission patterns change between weekdays and weekends or weather conditions and considering more sophisticated simulation scenarios. For example, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of policies that aim to improve walking, transit, or cycling on the distribution of emissions, the number of gross polluters, and grossly polluted roads. Finally, the relation between the vehicles' emissions and mobility patterns may be examined more deeply to investigate whether the observed heterogeneous distributions originate from other inequalities (e.g., socio-economic inequalities and centre-periphery divide). Meanwhile, our study may shape the discussion on measuring emissions with digital data and how to use such measurements to simulate emission reduction scenarios. If we learn how to use such a resource, we have the potential of monitoring in real-time the level of emission in our urban environments and taking immediate, informed actions when they overcome a certain tolerance threshold. This fact is crucial because policymakers' decisions depend on what we measure, how good our measurements are, and how promptly we react to these measurements." ;

The spatio-temporal patterns of the vehicles' trajectories are stable across the cities and the seasons of the year (see Supplementary Note 1). The trajectories are produced by onboard GPS devices, which automatically turn on when the vehicle starts, transmitting a point every minute to the server via a GPRS connection [48,50,22]. When the vehicle stops, no points are logged or sent. The GPS traces are collected by a company that provides a data collection service for insurance companies. The market penetration of this service is variable, but, in general, it covers at least 2% of the total registered vehicles, and it is representative of the overall amount of vehicles circulating in a city [48]. Figure 1a shows a sample of trajectories for 20 vehicles in Rome. We define a methodological framework to compute vehicles' emissions from their raw GPS trajectories (see Supplementary Figure 4). We filter the GPS trajectories so that the time between consecutive points is lower than a certain threshold (see Methods and Supplementary Note 2). For each vehicle, we estimate the instantaneous speed and acceleration in each point of its trajectory and filter out points with unrealistic values (see Methods and Figure 1b). We use a Nearest-Neighbour algorithm to assign the points to the city's roads based on road networks downloaded from OpenStreetMap (see Methods). The three cities are heterogeneous in their road networks: Rome is large but with the sparsest network; London is huge but with the densest network; Florence is small (≈ 1/12 of Rome and ≈ 1/15 of London in terms of land area) but with a dense road network (see Supplementary Note 3 for details). We use a microscopic emissions model [45] that uses speed, acceleration, and fuel type to estimate the vehicles' instantaneous emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) (see Methods). Finally, we compute each vehicle's overall emissions as the sum of all its instantaneous emissions during the study period. Analogously, we compute the overall amount of air pollutants on each road by summing up all the instantaneous emissions from any vehicle passing through that road during the same period (Figure 1c)." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "Data Filtering. In our GPS dataset, each trajectory point is associated with a vehicle identifier, a trajectory identifier, a timestamp, and a latitude/longitude pair. The sampling rate of the trajectory points may affect the estimate of instantaneous speed and acceleration. Since the mean time interval between trajectory points varies from city to city (it is about one minute for London and four minutes for Rome and Florence, see Table 1), we perform a pre-processing step to align them. For each trajectory, we retain only those sub-trajectories (i.e., disjoint subsets of points) that satisfy two constraints: (i) there are at least two points, and (ii) the time interval between consecutive points is less than θ = 120 seconds. The filtering step causes a drop in the number of points and, by consequence, of vehicles. We analyse the trends of both the number of vehicles and points resulting from the filtering step varying the filtering parameter θ from 1 second to 300 seconds (see Supplementary Note 1). By choosing θ = 120 seconds, we lose 53.5% of points in Rome, 1.4% in London, and 70.4% in Florence. Consequently, we discard 1.3% of vehicles in Rome, 0.9% in London, and 6.5% in Florence (see Table 1). Different works use different values for θ (e.g., the time interval between the points is set to 1 second [11], 3 seconds [59], 5 seconds [45], 5 to 50 seconds [39]). Our choice derives from our data sampling rate and is a trade-off between the reliability of the results and the data coverage. As the last step, we compute, for each vehicle, the speed and acceleration in each point, and retain only points whose speed is lower than 300 km/h and whose acceleration is in the range [−10, +10] m/s 2 (as suggested by Nyhan et al. [45]). Road network and GPS points snapping. The road network of each city is extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) [46], a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world and provide the geodata underlying the map. In particular, the road network is provided as a multigraph G = (V, E), with V being the set of nodes v and E being the multiset of edges e, in which the edges represent public roads accessible to vehicles (including service roads). Each edge e ∈ E is a pair of two identifiers, indicating the starting and ending OSM nodes, plus a key that discriminates between parallel edges (if present). Moreover, it carries some information about the road it represents, such as its name, length, and type (e.g., whether it is a motorway or residential street). In this context, we call crossroads the nodes v ∈ V that have at least two roads (i.e. edges e ∈ E) incident on them. To download, compute statistics, and visualise the road networks, we conceived methods based on the Python library OSMnx [5]. Our matching step consists of a ball tree Nearest-Neighbour algorithm that assigns each point of a GPS trajectory to its nearest edge in the road network. This point snapping step allows us to assign the vehicles' emissions to the roads onto which they are produced (see Figure 1c). Note that the Nearest-Neighbour algorithm used does not affect the quality of the emissions estimated with the microscopic model. Indeed, the instantaneous emissions are computed based on the points' speed and acceleration computed from the GPS data (not matched yet with the road network). Moreover, our GPS data come with a quality index that ranges from 1 to 3 and indicates the precision of each GPS point's location. A point's maximum quality (i.e., index = 3) indicates that at least four satellites' signals received by the GPS device are used for the trilateration of the point's location. Our study only uses the points with the highest quality (i.e., index = 3). Given this accuracy in the points' locations, the reconciliation problem is straightforward [67], and we assign the location obtained from the GPS receiver to the nearest edge in the network. Computing emissions. We implement a microscopic emissions model [45] to compute the instantaneous emissions associated with each trajectory point p. We denote the quantity of pollutant j ∈ {CO 2 , NO x , PM, VOC} emitted at point p from vehicle u as E j,u p and the instantaneous speed and acceleration of the vehicle in p as v p and a p , respectively. Information about its engine type (whether it is petrol, diesel, or LPG) is available for each vehicle. This information determines, together with the type of pollutant, the emission factors f i . We use the following equation to compute the instantaneous emissions E j,u p of pollutant j from vehicle u in point p: where for NO x and VOC emissions the factors f 1 , ..., f 6 change with acceleration (based on whether a p ≥ −0.5 m/s 2 or a p < −0.5 m/s 2 ). In Supplementary Table 16, we show the value of factors f 1 , . . . , f 6 varying the vehicle's type and acceleration. Mobility measures and roads' centrality. We use four quantities to describe the mobility of a vehicle u: • the radius of gyration [24,50,48]  , where P is the set of n points recorded for u, r i (u) indicates the coordinates of trajectory point i ∈ P , r cm (u) is the centre of mass of u, and dist the haversine distance between two points on earth; • the temporal-uncorrelated entropy [57,17,51] S(u) = − Nu i=1 p u (i) log 2 p u (i), where N u is the number of distinct locations visited by u, and p u (i) is the probability that u visits location i; • the travel time of u, computed as the sum of all the travel times of its trajectories. We measure the centrality of a road, a proxy of its traffic volume in the city, as its betweenness centrality. In network science, the betweenness centrality of an edge e (i.e., a road in our case) is defined as C b (e) = s,t∈V σ(s,t|e) σ(s,t) , where V is the set of nodes in the network, σ(s, t) is the number of shortest paths between s and t, and σ(s, t|e) is the number of those shortest paths passing through edge e. Home and work locations. The first step when identifying an individual's home and work locations is the selection of the starting and ending points of their trajectories [47]. The position of the starting (or ending) points of the trajectories that start from (or end to) the same semantic location may not coincide. This may happen because: (a) a driver can park the vehicle within a certain radius from the location; (b) since the first point sent by the GPS device often lacks precision and is discarded, the second point sent is taken as the starting point of the trajectory. For the above reason, we spatially cluster these points within a radius of 250 meters and take the centroid of each cluster as the vehicle's stop location. To identify a vehicle's home and work locations, we use a principle commonly adopted in the literature [47]: the home location is the stop location corresponding to the most frequent cluster; the work location is the stop location corresponding to the second most frequent cluster. We discard the vehicles for which it is impossible to identify the most frequent stop location(s) (for example, the vehicle visited each location only once). We successfully identify home and work locations for 55%, 31%, and 16% of the vehicles moving in London, Rome, and Florence, respectively. There are two main reasons we cannot identify the home and work locations of many vehicles in Florence. First, the average number of trajectories per vehicle (10.7) is much lower than in the other two cities (27.6 in Rome and 43 in London) (see Table 1). The fewer trajectories a vehicle has, the more difficult it is to identify its home and work locations. Second, while a relatively small city, Florence is an essential hub for the surroundings. Thus, many users could live outside the city. Moreover, even if they live inside the city, given various restricted traffic areas in the city's historic centre, many could reach the workplace by public transportation or walking. This leads to a low number of commuting trajectories inside the city. 1." ;
