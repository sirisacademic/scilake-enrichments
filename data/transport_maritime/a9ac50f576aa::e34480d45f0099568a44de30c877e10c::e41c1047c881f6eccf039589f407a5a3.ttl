        nif:anchorOf              "Guidelines for low-emission driving and technical requirements for a smartphone application were developed under the MODALES WP5 [22], taking into consideration the results from WP2, WP3 and WP4 activities. The MODALES app, a personal driving assistant implementing both real-time (active) and passive (report after each trip) recommendations to reduce emissions levels (linked to the MODALES impact 1 and 2), was developed and tested in WP6. Together with an online video training, its aim was to impact driving style and reduce pollutant emissions (MODALES solution 2: app and training). Impacts on the powertrain emissions, brake emissions and tyre emissions before and after using the MODALES app and training were tested. Because the app was used in conjunction with the training their impacts were measured together during the pilot trials. The MODALES app aimed to assist drivers throughout their journeys by providing recommendations that do not interfere with their driving (e.g., when stationary at a traffic light or in the form of sound notifications). The app had three separate modules: • A data collection module, which considered data from (a) OBD-II (e.g., engine rpm, vehicle speed), (b) phone sensors (e.g., accelerometer, wireless traces) and (c) the user. Using an OBD dongle was optional, this allowed end-users to use either a standalone application or one which relied on additional data. The lack of data induced by the absence of OBD lead to less data collected for the project's impact analysis, but still valid. Phones were, if possible, fixed in the car using a car holder, allowing the user to have a comfortable view of the phone's interface and for the proper recording of accelerometric data, i.e., using a stable reference in space. Ideally, the phones should have been positioned vertically, but the system also worked horizontally. • The data mentioned above was used as input to two scoring modules, enabling the creation of a local representation of the user's profile and distinguishing of different driving behaviours previously identified via laboratory tests and state-of-the-art reviews. These scoring modules computed, on one side, a real-time acceleration profile, and on the other side, a time series of scores, using a classification approach. Input data came from OBD dongle and phone sensors, while ground truth data was provided by the user and independent data such as GPS. • Finally, a recommendation module advised the user to adopt attitudes depending on their perceived driving behaviour. Based on the two sub-scores explained above, the mobile app generated two types of recommendations: • Active recommendations were presented to the user while driving. The user's driving style was analysed in real-time and transcribed into an acceleration score. Active recommendations required local data processing and storage. The user interface and possible interactions actions needed to be limited to preserve the user's safety. It was aimed to keep these recommendations simple. • Passive recommendations were given to the user after a trip. An end of trip report was generated, including textual recommendations, statistical analyses, and MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 contextual elements. This feedback aimed to allow drivers to learn from bad driving habits and improve their emissions reduction. Passive recommendations meant that data processing and storage was outsourced to an external server. The mobile app was developed in two different versions: the first only for data collection and the second with the full scoring and recommendation systems." ;

Finally, six respondents were not interested in using such an application, even if it were integrated into the vehicle and worked perfectly. A significant number of other responses and feedback was provided to this question of future use. These responses raised several important issues with the design and functionality of the app (such as its distractive qualities and its lack of clarity). Respondents highlighted mainly three categories of issues relating to: the real-time feedback feature, the interference of the MODALES app with their use of other apps (such as a maps or GPS app), the connection of the app with the OBD or dongle. With regards to issues with real time feedback, some respondents suggested that in addition to the colour change that there be hints towards to reason for the colour change to better understand the reason for the change. A few commented on the distractive nature of real-time feedback, with one respondent suggesting that only post-trip feedback be provided. Another respondent suggested that MODALES app features be integrated into the dashboard of the vehicle. With regards to the use of the MODALES app conflicting with the use of other apps, respondents suggested features to remedy this, such as: a floating window or widget, notification pop-ups, split screen. With regards to issues with the connection of the app to the OBD/dongle, a respondent suggested to include an indicator for the dongle/OBD connection in the active display. Another respondent suggested that the app (working with the dongle) provide a failure code explanation to the driver.

Among those inputs, the main requirement is the description of the national vehicles stock, segregated by engine type (Petrol, diesel, hybrid or electric) and by European standards (Table 13). Such information can be extrapolated at the European level for a fixed year, see for example [23], but it is a more complex task to get it for every European country. As stated by [24], only four countries (Germany, Spain, Finland and Italy) report on the combination of age class and engine type. As Euro standards are derived from the age of the vehicles, it is a challenge to obtain the needed data from any known source. Moreover, as the impact assessment needs to extrapolate the stock into the future, it is not only necessary to know the stock by engine type and euro standards, but also to know it over the past years, and in the future. Indeed, the evolution of the stock profile, segregated by Euro standard and ZEV uptake, plays a critical role in the emission reduction potential and associated health benefits [25]. After a careful analysis of the available data, authors had to face the evidence that such data is not available publicly anywhere, and that a dedicated model had to be developed. A literature review reveals that complex models have been developed in specific cases ( [26], [27]), but they are used to study long term impacts (2040-2050) of planned policies on the share of driving technologies. The MODALES solutions can be seen as transition solutions, temporarily effective until the target of a market dominated by electric vehicles is reached. Is it therefore not relevant to use such models as our target is the year 2025. Moreover, such models are developed for the national or regional level and cannot be extrapolated to other countries. A simpler and generalisable methodology has been settled-up to tackle this issue starting from harmonised and quality checked data from the Eurostat website. The sections below are describing in detail the proposed approach to estimate the evolution of the stock based upon the available data from Eurostat website." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "The transportation sector is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing these emissions has become a priority for many governments and organisations. One approach to reducing emissions is through the use of anti-tampering regulation measures and retrofit campaigns for older vehicles. MODALES impact assessment results have shown that the older the vehicle stock, the more savings can be expected from these measures. This is because older vehicles are often less fuel efficient and emit more pollutants than newer models. By retrofitting these vehicles with newer technology and implementing anti-tampering measures, emissions can be reduced and fuel efficiency can be improved. However, the effectiveness of these measures varies depending on the type of vehicle and the country in question. For example, countries with older vehicle stocks may see greater benefits from retrofit campaigns, while countries with newer stocks may see limited or no impact. Similarly, the potential savings from anti-tampering measures may be greater in some countries than in others. Another approach to reducing emissions is through behaviour-related changes, such as improving driving habits. MODALES impact assessment results have shown that there is significant potential for savings through app-based solutions and training programs that encourage more efficient driving. However, these solutions may not be as effective as OEM embedded systems, which are typically more expensive but also more efficient. Overall, the research suggests that there is significant potential for reducing emissions in the transportation sector through a combination of anti-tampering measures, retrofit campaigns, and behaviour-related changes. However, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of vehicle, the country in question, and the specific technology used. As such, a targeted and nuanced approach will be necessary to achieve meaningful reductions in emissions. Considering the feedback questionnaire analysis conducted among MODALES trial participants, the final survey focused on the use of the MODALES app and the extent to which drivers felt their driving style and behaviour had changed. The survey recorded 69 responses from volunteer drivers in pilot sites across seven countries. The majority of the respondents drove combustion engine vehicles, and around one-third of them used the app every time they drove during the trial period. The survey revealed that the app successfully encouraged behavioural changes in driving, with many respondents reporting a reduction in poor driving behaviour. However, several issues were raised with the app's design and functionality, particularly in relation to real-time feedback, interference with other apps, and connection with the OBD dongle. Respondents suggested several features to remedy these issues, including integration with the vehicle dashboard and more efficient technical support. Overall, the survey showed that a better performing and more stable version of the app would be welcomed by most respondents. MODALES D6. 4" ;

The first was the driver selection survey (included as an annex to MODALES D6.2 -Trial Management), which was administered individually by each participating project partner (site leader) to collect basic information such as vehicle type, age group, gender, driving experience and typical driving intensity (annual mileage, main trip purposes). These allowed the volunteer drivers to be selected, and this data provides context to the data analysis which is reported in Deliverable D6.3. The second survey followed the viewing of the training video by each participant and their move to Phase 2 of the trial. This focused on their understanding and acceptance of the video, the extent to which they learnt things and any other feedback. This is reported in MODALES D6.2 -Trial Management. This chapter reports on the final survey, after the end of Phase 2 of the trials, which covered the use of the MODALES app and the extent to which drivers felt their driving style and behaviour had changed as a result of the MODALES training video and the MODALES app advice and feedback. This survey used the EUSurvey online tool18 , for consistency with the second survey and to enable different language versions of the questionnaire. It was kept as short as possible (average response time 5-10 minutes) in order to elicit a satisfactory response rate. For two types of poor (high emitting) driving behaviour, it asked whether the user carried out this behaviour before taking the training and whether they now carry on with the same behaviour, they have modified (improved) a little, or have improved a lot (avoiding almost always this kind of poor behaviour). Alternatively, they already avoided poor behaviour and continue to do so after the training and using the app. The situations were: • Speeding up when the engine is cold; • Rapid accelerations, which might lead to a need for sudden braking. The questionnaire asked how regularly the driver used the app during the trial period (most or all trips, around half of trips, or only a few). For occasions when the driver did not use the app, they were asked why not (e.g. in a hurry, only a short trip, did not like the app or did not find it useful, had technical/connection problems with the app). It asked how the user reacted to real-time on-trip feedback from the app (simple colour changes), and also how they reacted to the post-trip feedback. Finally, this questionnaire recognised that some drivers had experienced difficulties such as getting the app to connect with the dongle, getting the app to send data, etc., and also reminded them that MODALES is a research project and not a commercial product. However, if this project led to a better performing and more stable version of this app being available, and available for free, it asked whether MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 they would use it.

However, the business case for retrofitting city buses is becoming weaker due to their age and decreasing mileage, as well as the risk of emissions returning to baseline levels with poor maintenance. Retrofitting for light duty vehicles, specifically Euro 5 vehicles, can reduce NOx emissions by 50-80%, but the low value of these vehicles compared to retrofit kits and the lack of motivation for retrofits make it commercially unfeasible. Retrofitting for cars faces challenges with the approval process due to the high variation of models and emission reduction under real driving conditions. While technically possible, the political climate surrounding diesel vehicles also poses a challenge. Retrofitting is feasible when emissions exceed current emission standards and the vehicle has a long enough lifetime left. The MODALES proposal is to generalise retrofit whenever it is possible. The way this is modelled into the COPERT software is explained in section 3.5.2." ;

The studies performed helped to evaluate the targeted population of vehicles, together with the range of proportion for which SCR + DPF is applicable. The targeted population of vehicles are the following: light commercial vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and buses. This solution is only applicable to diesel vehicles. In order to build a lower and an upper scenario, we use the uncertainty associate with the estimation of the proportion of vehicles for which the solution is applicable. From the studies made by CERTH within MODALES and from expert knowledge, we can derive the following results for the proportion of vehicles with SCR + DPF applicable: Once a vehicle is equipped with a SCR+DPF system, the observed reductions are the following: • CO: 50% • NOx: 70% • VOC: 50% • PM: 90% Although the VOC (Volatil Organic Components) emission is estimated using COPERT simulations, results are not displayed in this deliverable for consistency between the different solutions and because VOC are not in the scope of MODALES studies. It is then possible to mix all these parameters to estimate the potential reduction of emissions. For example, if we consider the NOx emissions, and the light commercial vehicles fleet for the lower scenario, the proposed measure is expected to reduce by 70% the emissions for 0.5% of the fleet. This translates into a reduction 0.35% for the whole fleet (0.5x0.7). The final parameters used are indicated in the tables below." ;

The app adopts a modular approach, allowing several small components to be developed independently and then interact with each other to provide a unique driver experience. The app has been developed for Android and iOS, using the Flutter framework to avoid working on two code bases. To prevent breaches of privacy, most of the processes operate locally on the mobile phone, allowing the system to operate even without internet connectivity. The app is broken down into three modules: data collection, scoring, and recommendation. The data collected from the OBD-II, phone sensors, and the user is used as input to two scoring modules that distinguish different driving behaviours. Finally, the recommendation module advises the user to adopt attitudes depending on their perceived driving behaviour. Passive recommendations are given to the user after a trip, while active recommendations are presented in real-time while driving. The feedback allows drivers to learn from bad driving habits and improve their emissions reduction. Together with online training videos (see MODALES website: https://modales-project.eu/media), the app is assumed to impact the driving style and generate benefits on pollutant emissions. Results from the MODALES test trials and experiments are used to extrapolate the observed effects of these joint solutions using the COPERT software (section 3.5.3)." ;

The MODALES app together with the offline/online training, should induce driving behaviour modifications that could impact brake and tyre emissions. Long-term effects on emissions may also appear through a better care of the vehicle. Unfortunately, collecting field measures of non-engine PM emissions while adopting the MODALES App recommended driving style are not possible, as it is not feasible to distinct brake and tyre emissions from engine emissions using PEMS data. Scaling up from experimental data is feasible at the aggregated level. The goal is to make use of internal databases and models available through industrial partners, to estimate brake and tyre emissions based on driving behaviour field data (acceleration and braking behaviour for example). Such models were settled thanks to the University of Leeds, and the obtained results have been presented in [2]. Unfortunately, these models cannot be used to estimate tyre and brakes emissions from the data collected during the trial tests. Instead, tyre and brakes emissions have been integrated in the score produced by Okan university using VTT test data. The results presented in this deliverable will use this model linking the score to aggregate emissions, which includes tyre and brakes emissions. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 Expected Impact 2: Contribute to reduction of unnecessary driver-induced emissions though a better awareness by the public of their role in controlling polluting emissions Among MODALES solutions, driver behaviour is only impacted by the app and online/offline training, at least for short-and medium-term effects. Increasing tampering detection can induce long term effects on driving, but this is not estimable through MODALES project and can be considered negligible at first sight." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "The MODALES project aims to reduce air pollution from all types of road vehicles by encouraging the adoption of low-emitting driving behaviours that reduce emissions, vehicle retrofits and inspections to detect poorly maintained and tampered vehicles. To evaluate the different approaches and strategies proposed by MODALES, COPERT software is used to compare baseline vehicle emissions for some European countries with the estimated emissions after the implementation of MODALES solutions. It specifically measures the emission savings by estimating air pollutant emissions and greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles for the following pollutants: CO2, CO, NOx, and PM. A simplified scheme that describes the process of assessing the impact of MODALES proposed solutions on vehicle emissions is shown in Figure 4  COPERT has been widely used by researchers, government agencies, and industry professionals for emission inventory development, policy analysis, and the evaluation of emission reduction measures. It helps in understanding the environmental impact of road transport and provides valuable insights for developing sustainable transportation policies and strategies. COPERT is a stand-alone software application that uses csv or xls files mainly as input. When the user opens a database file or creates a new one with COPERT 5, automatically a temporary file is created, where all the changes that are made during the process are saved. After the user completes the necessary calculation steps and saves the changes, the input file becomes the output one that can be used again as an input file by the same or another user (Figure 5). The user can provide input data to the application either by using the application's window forms, or by importing data from Microsoft Excel files (.xls or .csv files).  Figure 6 illustrates the whole procedure of estimation with COPERT. It consists of importing, for a specific country, all information (parameters) that represent the characteristic of the source of pollutants in that region. An explanation of COPERT parameters for Spain is presented below." ;

        nif:anchorOf              "France's share of Euro standard (Figure 30) is similar to the Turkish one, except that proportions of Euro 6d is about 24% (17.6% for Turkey). Very few benefits are expected from this category of vehicles as their emissions are already low compared to the other standards. Therefore, savings up to 59.6% could be expected for CO emissions, but only 5.2% in the more realistic lower scenario. CO2 savings range from 3.8 to 4.2%, in line with other countries. NOx emissions reductions range from 6.9% up to 39.4%. For PMs, reductions range from 1.1% (PM10, lower), up to 3.8% (PM2.5, upper). One can notice that PM reductions are mostly the result of antitampering measures, while retrofits have a very low impact on all the pollutants. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023  Germany's results (Figure 33) are similar to France, in the sense that benefits from the App and training could reach very high levels due to the large fleet of passenger cars. CO emissions reduction ranges from 5.3% to 60.2%, the upper reduction among all the studied countries. CO2 reductions are consistent with previous results, ranging from 4.3% to 3.8%. It could be noticed that the MODALES impacts on PM emissions are under 1%, which is the minimum observed among the studied countries. This is due to the very low penetration rate of Euro 4 vehicles in Germany, which is the category of vehicles for which the impacts of retrofit is greatest. Finally, NOx emissions show great potential for reduction, as they range from 6.3% up to 36.2%, with an important impact from anti tampering measures (between 3.5% and 7.4%" ;

For example, in France, such data exists but it mixes the engine type with the \"Critair\" segmentation (national categorisation of vehicles emissions) instead of the Euro standards, and it is not straightforward to set up the link between the two. Several other European countries are not providing any data, and Eurostat data is likely to be the most exhaustive resource available that time. Even within Eurostat data, several parts are missing or have not been transmitted by some countries. Due to this reason, it was not possible to compute the impact of MODALES solutions to all the relevant countries in which the trial test took place. The following countries have been considered: Finland, Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Germany. Luxembourg, Greece, and Great Britain have too much missing data to reconstruct the stock across the years. France and Germany have been added to the list despite the absence of test trials in these countries, but because their stock of vehicles are the biggest in Europe.

In order to model this solution using COPERT software, we need to estimate its effects by making some assumptions based on a literature survey and on the MODALES experiments and studies. The following assumptions are made: 1. 10% of the fleet of light & heavy duty vehicles is being tampered [20]. Under these assumptions, it is possible to estimate the effect of the proposed measure. As an example, if 50% of the 10% tampered vehicles are detected, that means the measure saves the equivalent of 5% additional tampered vehicles. From ICCT studies we could estimate these 5% tampered vehicles to be responsible for an increase of 2x5=10% for PM and NOx emissions, which is a conservative approach as it could range up to 3 times. When reasoning on the opposite way, it could calculated how much reduction is expected when decreasing the population of tampered vehicles from 10% to 7.5% (lower scenario) or to 5% (upper scenario).

In addition, the deliverable discusses the challenges and lessons learned during the evaluation process and identifies areas for improvement or further research. MODALES developed innovation solutions to address the complex issues explained above, that are divided into four main areas: drivers and their driving behaviour, retrofits that enable emissions to be reduced, the EOBD that enables to malfunctioning to be notified, and inspections to detect poorly maintained and tampered vehicles. The innovation solutions from MODALES could be transformed into practical solutions, ready to be implemented by European countries. All these forms of actions should affect direct or indirect emissions, but through different process. From the detailed technical studies from MODALES partners, and from studies about European national regulations, three main practical solutions are proposed, and their potential impacts tested through scenarios built upon MODALES trial tests and studies results: The first solution consists of a regulation policy to detect poorly maintained and tampered vehicles that can be summarised by the two following measures. • Mandatory tampering detection using OBD (On-Board Diagnostic systems) data during Periodic Technical Inspections; The impact of this solution is done by estimating the proportion of vehicles for which retrofit is relevant based on MODALES cost benefits analyses [1] . The third solution is a mobile app for low-emission driving that aims to assist drivers throughout their journeys by providing recommendations that do not interfere with their driving. The feedback allows drivers to learn from bad driving habits and improve their emissions reduction. Together with an online training (videos available in the Media section of the MODALES website: https://modalesproject.eu/media, supported by an awareness campaign with low-emission driving tips, here: https://modales-project.eu/campaign), the app is assumed to impact the driving style and generate benefits on pollutant emissions. The combined impact of the app and the training is evaluated through the experimental and large scale trial tests results conducted within MODALES. The proposed methodology for Impact assessment is based on the COPERT software, which is used to compare baseline vehicle emissions for some European countries (Finland, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Germany, and France) with the estimated emissions after the implementation of MODALES solutions. It specifically measures the emission savings by estimating air pollutant emissions and greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles for the following pollutants: CO2, CO, NOx, and PM. In fact, COPERT is the EU standard vehicle emissions calculator. It requires detailed data as inputs, such as stock configuration share across EU standards, energy type and vehicle type. Such a level of precision is usually not available from EU countries, so MODALES developed an alternative estimation algorithm based on Eurostat open data sets to estimate the year 2025 situation. Among all the countries where a MODALES trial took place, only four had a sufficient amount of data to reconstruct the stock until the Euro 4 standard, starting in 2011. For the China it was difficult to find historical data from 2011 and the proposed methodology could not therefore be applied. For each Innovation Solution, assumptions are made based on literature survey or MODALES results and experts' knowledge. These assumptions are used to build different scenarios. First, a \"lower\" scenario is built based on a pessimistic assumption, then an optimistic scenario is built and called \"upper\". These scenarios are then translated into a set of quantitative assumptions on the emissions that are suitable to be used as an input parameter into COPERT software, through the \"Vehicle performance improvement\" parameter box (see details Figure 11, page 31). The baseline performances are estimated using the evolution of the vehicles fleet share across Euro standards for each studied country. A simple reconstruction method is proposed: Eurostat data is used to rebuild the share of Euro standards starting from year 2010, up to the year 2021. Missing data are extrapolated linearly when necessary, and the future evolution of the stock until 2025 is estimated by extending the linear trend over the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 A summary of the results is presented in the above figure, providing the range of emissions reductions from the lower scenario (pessimistic) to the upper one (optimistic). Also, this figure provide the estimates obtained by MODALES previous works at the individual level and already explained in previous deliverables ( [1], [2]). Results shows that the older the vehicle stock, the more savings can be expected from the MODALES proposed solutions. This is because older vehicles are often less fuel efficient and emit more pollutants than newer models. By retrofitting these vehicles with newer technology and implementing antitampering measures, emissions can be reduced and fuel efficiency can be significantly improved at the country level. However, the effectiveness of these measures varies depending on the type of vehicle and the country in question. For example, countries with older vehicle stocks may see greater benefits from retrofit campaigns, while countries with newer stocks may see limited or no impact. Similarly, the potential savings from anti-tampering measures may be greater in some countries than in others. Results also shows that there is significant potential for savings through app-based solutions and training programs that encourage more efficient driving. However, these solutions may not be as effective as OEM embedded systems, which are typically more expensive but also more efficient, particularly on the long term. Overall, the research suggests that there is significant potential for reducing emissions in the transportation sector through a combination of anti-tampering measures, retrofit campaigns, and behaviour-related changes. However, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of vehicle, the country in question, and the specific technology used. As such, a targeted and nuanced approach will be necessary to achieve meaningful reductions in emissions. The MODALES trial conducted three surveys among its participants. The final survey focused on the use of the MODALES app and the extent to which drivers felt their driving style and behaviour had changed. The survey recorded 69 responses from volunteer drivers in pilot sites across seven countries. Majority of the respondents drove combustion engine vehicles, and around one-third of them used MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 the app every time they drove during the trial period. The survey revealed that the app successfully encouraged behavioural changes in driving, with many respondents reporting a reduction in poor driving behaviour. However, several issues were raised with the app's design and functionality, particularly in relation to real-time feedback, interference with other apps, and connection with OBD/dongle. Respondents suggested several features to remedy these issues, including integration with the vehicle dashboard and more efficient technical support. Overall, the survey showed that a better performing and more stable version of the app would be welcomed by most respondents. Finally, this deliverable is an essential component of Work Package 6 of the MODALES project, which highlights the effectiveness of implementing low emission driving behaviours and proper vehicle maintenance practices. The results provide valuable information to decision makers, stakeholders, and researchers in their efforts to achieve zero air pollution from road vehicles. 1. Introduction The MODALES project works towards reducing air pollution from all types of on-road vehicles by encouraging adoption of low-emission driving behaviour and proper maintenance choice. MODALES pursues a user-centric approach to addressing all of the challenges which on the one hand enhance low-emission practices and on the other hand suppress high-emission behaviour by researching, developing and testing a number of innovative and complementary solutions in four key areas (driver, retrofits, EOBD and inspection) in order to reduce vehicle emissions from three main sources: powertrain, brakes and tyres. MODALES aimed to modify user (driver) behaviour via dedicated training including a driver assistance app and awareness campaigns in order to support effective air quality improvement plans and enforcement strategies to be developed by local and national authorities. To achieve this goal, MODALES has researched, developed, and tested 13 innovation solutions (IS), of which 11 were technical innovations. The main activities of MODALES have been the following: • Measurement of real-world vehicle emissions and driving behaviour to produce accurate correlation between them using advanced mathematical and statistical techniques; • Exploration of the most advanced technologies for retrofits designed to substantially reduce powertrain emissions from all types of vehicles and to validate their effectiveness under different real-world traffic and environment conditions, and by various drivers; • Undertaking an in-depth analysis of OBDs, periodic inspection and legal issues on tampering in Europe to help regulatory authorities put in place effective anti-tampering legislation, and to help owners properly maintain their vehicles; • Conducting low-emission user trials (with both driving and maintenance practices), supported by awareness campaigns, to enhance public engagement and help drivers better understand the impact of their driving and maintenance behaviours in all situations. • WP3: Impact of user behaviours, which undertook a series of measurement campaigns to establish the interconnection between driving behaviour and powertrain exhaust emissions, as well as fine particulates from brakes and mass-loss from tyres. Measurement campaigns were also carried out to address the impact of poor maintenance and deliberate tampering of the emissions control system. • WP4: Effectiveness of inspections and depollution systems, which used the findings of WPs 2 and 3 as a base to investigate and propose solutions that will contribute to emission monitoring via the EOBD protocol and systems that detect lack of maintenance and tampering. It also investigated the potential of enhancing existing retrofit systems. • WP5: Guidelines and tools for low-emission training, which took into consideration results from the above WPs to define guidelines for low-emission driving and to specify the technical requirements for a smartphone application (the MODALES App). This app was developed and tested in this WP. Training courses were also designed to ensure a consistency with existing learning processes and serve as input for on-road trials and awareness campaigns. The main objective of WP6 was to develop an evaluation plan and to test and evaluate with real-world trials the functionality of the innovations developed in MODALES, their effects on driver acceptance and performance, and their potential wider impact (in particular their predicted overall effects on vehicle emissions). WP6 is broken down into five tasks, with this report covering the results of Task 6.5: • T6. This deliverable is public. It summarises the main findings and conclusions from the MODALES technical studies and wrap-up the findings in the form of practical solutions. This deliverable presents the assumptions about the plausible impacts associated with such measures, then extrapolate the findings at the national level using COPERT software [3]. The content of this deliverable is slightly different from the planned actions in the evaluation plan [4] as the project faced some significant delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trial tests have been shortened, the number of participants has been reduced, and therefore also the delivery of the data. New plans have been made to extrapolate the results at the national level instead of the initial plan to extrapolate at the city level. Therefore, the extrapolation of the impacts relies on the COPERT software, instead of the previously envisioned SUMI indicators (see sections below for further details about these two solutions). MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 The overall objective of the MODALES project is to improve air quality, but the direct impact of the project will be on the knowledge of the factors affecting emissions, and on the development of tools and communication campaigns to promote behaviour change. On the one hand, improvement of knowledge on the factors affecting emissions will be among experts and by guidelines, while the behavioural change promoted by MODALES project will focus on the enduser, in terms of both proper vehicle maintenance (including anti-tampering and retrofitting) and the driving style for lower emissions. Many studies found that the majority of car users are unaware of the influence of their driving habits and other actions on the emissions they create. Also, motorists in general do not pay much attention to exhaust emissions, as they are mostly not visible and easily ignored, as are brake and tyre emissions. Hence, MODALES aims to make users more aware of these issues and, at the same time, to address behaviour that can lead to higher emissions, such as careless driving habits and lack of maintenance, or even purposeful tampering of the emissions control systems. Therefore, the goal of MODALES is to address the challenges of, on one hand, enhancing low-emission practices and, on the other hand, suppressing high-emission behaviours, through two main domains of knowledge: the Vehicle domain, and the Driving domain. MODALES develops innovation solutions to address the complex issues explained above, that are divided into four main areas: drivers and their driving behaviour, retrofits that enable emissions to be reduced, the EOBD that enables to notify malfunctioning, and inspections to detect poorly maintained and tampered vehicles (Figure 1). MODALES innovation solutions are diverse and complementary, and can be linked to the expected impacts (listed in The previous innovation solutions from MODALES could be transformed into practical solutions, ready to be implemented by European countries. From the detailed technical studies from MODALES partners, and from studies about European national regulations, three main practical solutions have been proposed. The possible implementation of these solutions is described in the next sections. The implementation of EATS has resulted in a noteworthy decrease in actual emission levels, however, tampering with this system is a common occurrence. This is often done to cut costs by avoiding repair expenses for malfunctions, consumables, and for performance tuning. To address this issue, MODALES partners proposed an information system, the Information System for Vehicle Anti-tampering as shown in Figure 2: Workflow of the proposed Information System for Vehicle Anti-tampering, that can identify and notify possible tampering or insufficient engine maintenance problems, as well as higher engine horsepower of a vehicle. The objective of this system is to protect the environment and improve the air quality. By detecting and addressing these issues, we can ensure that the EATS system is functioning effectively and efficiently, and that the emissions are within the acceptable limits. This will not only benefit the environment but also promote sustainable transportation practices. The most common tampering techniques are the following: • The most common method is to disable the EGR or DPF system; • ECU re-flashing: Alters the ECU flash and perform checks using test drives or dyno tests; MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 • Emulators: Devices that attack the SCR system; • Modifiers: Hardware solutions that are simpler to emulators and aim to alter the control state of an EATS; • OBD Suppressors: These devices sent specific CAN-bus messages to suppress the on-board diagnostics of the vehicle. This Information System based on OBD Data is designed to enhance the security of vehicles by leveraging data from the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) system. The system architecture consists of a mobile phone application that receives vehicle data through an OBDLink MX+ dongle device. The data is then transmitted to a server for processing, transformation, and loading into a database. The server also implements data analytics and generates notifications based on the analysis. The website presents the aggregated data in an easy-to-understand format. The system is designed to ensure that any tampering with the vehicle is detected and reported promptly. The OBD system provides real-time data on the vehicle's performance, which can be used to detect any anomalies that may indicate tampering. The server processes the data to identify any missing values and transforms it into a format that can be easily analysed. The data analytics component of the system uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and generate alerts when unusual activity is detected. Overall, the information system is a powerful tool for enhancing the security of vehicles and preventing tampering. The system provides real-time monitoring and analysis of vehicle performance, enabling prompt detection of any anomalies and ensuring that appropriate action can be taken to prevent further damage. The MODALES project proposed to extrapolate the potential effects of a poor maintenance and tampering detection measure that could be summarised by the two following measures. • Mandatory tampering detection using OBD data during the periodic inspections; MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 • Penalties to vehicle owners when a manipulation of the vehicle data by an aftermarket software is detected. The way the effects of these measures are modelled to be implement into COPERT is described in section 3.5.1. Retrofitting for vehicles, particularly city buses and NRMM vehicles, has been proven effective in reducing emissions of PM and NOx. However, the business case for retrofitting city buses is becoming weaker due to their age and decreasing mileage, as well as the risk of emissions returning to baseline levels with poor maintenance. Retrofitting for light duty vehicles, specifically Euro 5 vehicles, can reduce NOx emissions by 50-80%, but the low value of these vehicles compared to retrofit kits and the lack of motivation for retrofits make it commercially unfeasible. Retrofitting for cars faces challenges with the approval process due to the high variation of models and emission reduction under real driving conditions. While technically possible, the political climate surrounding diesel vehicles also poses a challenge. Retrofitting is feasible when emissions exceed current emission standards and the vehicle has a long enough lifetime left. The MODALES proposal is to generalise retrofit whenever it is possible. The way this is modelled into the COPERT software is explained in section 3.5.2. MODALES has developed a mobile app for low-emission driving that aims to assist drivers throughout their journeys by providing recommendations that do not interfere with their driving. The app adopts a modular approach, allowing several small components to be developed independently and then interact with each other to provide a unique driver experience. The app has been developed for Android and iOS, using the Flutter framework to avoid working on two code bases. To prevent breaches of privacy, most of the processes operate locally on the mobile phone, allowing the system to operate even without internet connectivity. The app is broken down into three modules: data collection, scoring, and recommendation. The data collected from the OBD-II, phone sensors, and the user is used as input to two scoring modules that distinguish different driving behaviours. Finally, the recommendation module advises the user to adopt attitudes depending on their perceived driving behaviour. Passive recommendations are given to the user after a trip, while active recommendations are presented in real-time while driving. The feedback allows drivers to learn from bad driving habits and improve their emissions reduction. Together with online training videos (see MODALES website: https://modales-project.eu/media), the app is assumed to impact the driving style and generate benefits on pollutant emissions. Results from the MODALES test trials and experiments are used to extrapolate the observed effects of these joint solutions using the COPERT software (section 3.5.3). MODALES is expected to have a direct impact on the knowledge of the factors affecting emissions, and on the development of tools and communication campaigns to promote behaviour change. the outcome of the trials may be able to provide technical evidence for current regulations (although that is not their main purpose). The fourth impact, International Cooperation, is a non-technical impact, so is not included in the technical assessment. Expected Impact 1: Contribute to reduction of emissions from the existing combustionengine car fleet Impact Performance Indicator 1: Expected average of 20-35% reduction in pollutant emissions for tampered/poorly maintained vehicles. The hypothesis assumes there will be a significant increase in the detection rate for tampered or poorly maintained vehicles. The measurement therefore depends on both the detection rate, the accuracy of detection and the detected levels of degradation of performance of tampered/poorly maintained vehicles. Data came from lab tests performed by VTT as well as limited controlled road tests in Finland. Also the knowledge about tampering detection includes vehicle inspection records in three countries (Finland, Greece and Turkey), although we recognise that these inspection records do not tell the full story, because mostly the problems are rectified before going into inspection. Previous results are used to estimate the most probable range of detection rates. Research question: How well does the system perform in real use cases? MODALES partner Proventia is monitoring the effects of retrofits (NOxBUSTER) on HDVs (buses and garbage trucks) and has also retrofitted a van (Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 216, Euro5) as part of WP4 in MODALES. The results of these tests are providing ranges for emissions reductions that could be expected from a retrofitted vehicle. They are presented in [1] in details for the interested reader. Research question: What is the potential reduction of brake and tyre emissions (for different vehicles and road conditions) due to MODALES? The MODALES app together with the offline/online training, should induce driving behaviour modifications that could impact brake and tyre emissions. Long-term effects on emissions may also appear through a better care of the vehicle. Unfortunately, collecting field measures of non-engine PM emissions while adopting the MODALES App recommended driving style are not possible, as it is not feasible to distinct brake and tyre emissions from engine emissions using PEMS data. Scaling up from experimental data is feasible at the aggregated level. The goal is to make use of internal databases and models available through industrial partners, to estimate brake and tyre emissions based on driving behaviour field data (acceleration and braking behaviour for example). Such models were settled thanks to the University of Leeds, and the obtained results have been presented in [2]. Unfortunately, these models cannot be used to estimate tyre and brakes emissions from the data collected during the trial tests. Instead, tyre and brakes emissions have been integrated in the score produced by Okan university using VTT test data. The results presented in this deliverable will use this model linking the score to aggregate emissions, which includes tyre and brakes emissions. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 Expected Impact 2: Contribute to reduction of unnecessary driver-induced emissions though a better awareness by the public of their role in controlling polluting emissions Among MODALES solutions, driver behaviour is only impacted by the app and online/offline training, at least for short-and medium-term effects. Increasing tampering detection can induce long term effects on driving, but this is not estimable through MODALES project and can be considered negligible at first sight. Research question: To what extent (and range) can vehicle emissions be reduced by using the MODALES app and training? The app can be considered as a member of the \"Driver behaviour and eco-driving systems family\", as defined by the EU project Amitran (Assessment Methodologies for ICT in multimodal transport from User Behaviour to CO2 reduction) 1 and described in the paper \"Scaling up methodology for CO2 emissions of ICT applications in traffic and transport in Europe\" [5]. Such systems work continuously and their recommendations are applicable in all kinds of situations. According to Amitran recommendations, scaling-up is possible and straightforward when field data is collected through different road types and driving conditions. The impact to be tested are the powertrain emissions, brake emissions and tyre emissions before and after using the MODALES app and training. As the training is to be used in conjunction with the app, they will be measured together (no analysis of app only or training only). The large number of MODALES experiments finely captures the variability of driving behaviour across European countries. The FESTA methodology applied to MODALES research questions provides statistical evidence about the emission reduction across these various conditions, but also on the acceptance of the app and the adoption of recommendations through questionnaires. These questionnaires results are discussed at section 6. This chapter sets out high-level Research Questions (RQs) which the evaluation process should answer. To do this, each research question is associated with one or more hypothesis and each hypothesis will be measured by one or more performance indicator. The impact assessment part is different from the validation, as this is not direct measurement of the output of the different technologies but involves modelling, deployment scenarios, scaling up, together with assumptions or value judgements to estimate the real effect of the different technologies and procedures together. These are mapped by means of the expected impacts given in the MODALES DoA (three main impact areas and five Impact Performance Indicators -IPIs). MODALES D6. 4 Each innovation solution developed within MODALES can be associated with one or more high-level research question. Figure 3 presents graphically the information provided in section 2.3 and 2.4. measures would make some 10+ % improvement, which in aggregate make the 30 to 40% improvement in the \"catch rate\" of the processes to identify high emitting defected vehicles, as well as in preventing motorists from tampering their vehicles. Clearly such outcomes rely on the effectiveness of legislative measures: these should work so that they primarily deter motorists from defecting and tampering with their vehicles. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023  Impact assessment methodologies for the estimation of road transport emissions play a crucial role in analysing and understanding the environmental impact of transport systems [6]. At this level different approaches and solutions could be applied to reduce emissions. To evaluate these solutions and to calculate emissions and energy consumption for a specific country or region, the following general steps should be made: 1. Collect data on energy production and consumption: This data will include information according to the types of energy sources (diesel, gasoline or petrol, electric batteries). This data can be obtained from various sources, such as government statistical agencies, international organisations, and industry associations. Emissions factors are coefficients that relate the amount of energy consumed to the amount of greenhouse gases GHGs emitted. They are specific to each type of fuel and depend on the technology used to convert it into energy. Emissions factors can be obtained from national and international databases [3]. The calculation depends on the energy consumption for each fuel, its corresponding emissions factor and the performance improvement by the proposed solution. Compare the results to historical data and to other countries or regions and Identify the main sources of emissions and areas where emissions reductions could be achieved. In the literature, there are several tools available for calculating emissions and energy consumption by vehicles. These tools help evaluate the emissions generated by vehicles and provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers to develop sustainable transportation strategies. Here are a couple of options: 1. Fuel Economy [7]: This is an online tool developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that allows users to compare the fuel economy, emissions, and energy consumption of different vehicles. The tool provides estimates of fuel costs and emissions for different driving conditions and can be used to compare the environmental impact of different vehicles. [8]: is a framework developed by the European Commission to assess and measure urban mobility and transportation systems. It provides a standardised set of indicators that capture various dimensions of urban mobility, enabling cities to monitor their performance and track progress towards sustainable and efficient transportation.   The MODALES project aims to reduce air pollution from all types of road vehicles by encouraging the adoption of low-emitting driving behaviours that reduce emissions, vehicle retrofits and inspections to detect poorly maintained and tampered vehicles. To evaluate the different approaches and strategies proposed by MODALES, COPERT software is used to compare baseline vehicle emissions for some European countries with the estimated emissions after the implementation of MODALES solutions. It specifically measures the emission savings by estimating air pollutant emissions and greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles for the following pollutants: CO2, CO, NOx, and PM. A simplified scheme that describes the process of assessing the impact of MODALES proposed solutions on vehicle emissions is shown in Figure 4  COPERT has been widely used by researchers, government agencies, and industry professionals for emission inventory development, policy analysis, and the evaluation of emission reduction measures. It helps in understanding the environmental impact of road transport and provides valuable insights for developing sustainable transportation policies and strategies. COPERT is a stand-alone software application that uses csv or xls files mainly as input. When the user opens a database file or creates a new one with COPERT 5, automatically a temporary file is created, where all the changes that are made during the process are saved. After the user completes the necessary calculation steps and saves the changes, the input file becomes the output one that can be used again as an input file by the same or another user (Figure 5). The user can provide input data to the application either by using the application's window forms, or by importing data from Microsoft Excel files (.xls or .csv files).  Figure 6 illustrates the whole procedure of estimation with COPERT. It consists of importing, for a specific country, all information (parameters) that represent the characteristic of the source of pollutants in that region. An explanation of COPERT parameters for Spain is presented below. , [10]): In this format, the user provides values for monthly relative humidity, minimum and maximum average temperatures for each year. This is required to calculate the load of air-conditioning (A/C) and the fuel evaporation. Stock configuration [11]: In this section, the user should select which types of vehicles will be in the fleet of the selected year. In our case, we have selected: four types of vehicles This section explains how to translate MODALES innovation solutions into set of parameters suitable to be used as tuning parameters for COPERT simulations. For each Innovation Solution, assumptions are made based on literature survey or MODALES results and experts' knowledge. These assumptions are used to build different scenarios. First, a \"lower\" scenario is built based on a pessimistic assumption, then an optimistic scenario is built and called \"upper\". In the sections below, each innovative solution is translated into assumptions and parameters, together with the explanation or the relevant source. The final parameters are gathered into tables easily readable. According to the MODALES results [2], it is proposed to implement a poor maintenance and tampering detection measure with the following main aspects: • Mandatory tampering detection using OBD data during the periodic inspections Under the assumption that 10% of all vehicle types are tampered on average, this solution could impact all categories of vehicles (passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy duty trucks & buses) and all euro standards ( [20], [21]). In order to model this solution using COPERT software, we need to estimate its effects by making some assumptions based on a literature survey and on the MODALES experiments and studies. The following assumptions are made: 1. 10% of the fleet of light & heavy duty vehicles is being tampered [20]. Under these assumptions, it is possible to estimate the effect of the proposed measure. As an example, if 50% of the 10% tampered vehicles are detected, that means the measure saves the equivalent of 5% additional tampered vehicles. From ICCT studies we could estimate these 5% tampered vehicles to be responsible for an increase of 2x5=10% for PM and NOx emissions, which is a conservative approach as it could range up to 3 times. When reasoning on the opposite way, it could calculated how much reduction is expected when decreasing the population of tampered vehicles from 10% to 7.5% (lower scenario) or to 5% (upper scenario). The calculated values are indicated in the table below. The second type of solution proposed by MODALES consist of generalising retrofit systems when it is relevant. The studies performed helped to evaluate the targeted population of vehicles, together with the range of proportion for which SCR + DPF is applicable. The targeted population of vehicles are the following: light commercial vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and buses. This solution is only applicable to diesel vehicles. In order to build a lower and an upper scenario, we use the uncertainty associate with the estimation of the proportion of vehicles for which the solution is applicable. From the studies made by CERTH within MODALES and from expert knowledge, we can derive the following results for the proportion of vehicles with SCR + DPF applicable: Once a vehicle is equipped with a SCR+DPF system, the observed reductions are the following: • CO: 50% • NOx: 70% • VOC: 50% • PM: 90% Although the VOC (Volatil Organic Components) emission is estimated using COPERT simulations, results are not displayed in this deliverable for consistency between the different solutions and because VOC are not in the scope of MODALES studies. It is then possible to mix all these parameters to estimate the potential reduction of emissions. For example, if we consider the NOx emissions, and the light commercial vehicles fleet for the lower scenario, the proposed measure is expected to reduce by 70% the emissions for 0.5% of the fleet. This translates into a reduction 0.35% for the whole fleet (0.5x0.7). The final parameters used are indicated in the tables below. In addition to the engine and its control policies, it is possible to act on driving behaviour by means of instant feedback or appropriate courses. MODALES has developed a dedicated app that incorporates several algorithms specifically developed within the project and used as a basis for immediate feedback. This solution combines two actions: firstly, a short training course that can be followed remotely thanks to a video, and secondly, an app companion that provides simple, immediate feedback and advice after the journey. The combination of these two features is expected to have an impact on different types of emissions. The experimental protocol of the adopter did not allow the results to be split between these two features. The proposed impact assessment follows the same approach as the previous two solutions: a lower and an upper scenario are designed. The extrapolation of pollutant emissions is always challenging, as their measurement requires special and expensive tools such as PEMS (Portable Emission Measurements). Only the road tests carried out by VTT (Finland) benefit from such a precise measurement tool. Although very accurate and informative, these tests suffer from a lack of representativeness for the following reasons: Firstly, only 6 drivers drove the instrumented cars, and secondly, the route was always the same, mixing traffic conditions, but certainly not representative of the average conditions of a European driver. Despite these drawbacks, the results are the only accurate measurements available. They are available in Table 7. It can be assumed that the drivers were in an optimal condition to apply the training course carefully. The laboratory conditions, i.e. driving an instrumented car together with a technician, are known to be a favourable condition for the subjects' compliance with the experimenter's expected wishes. Based on this knowledge, the VTT results are used as parameters for the upper scenario. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 Based on VTT results for petrol cars, Okan University developed a machine learning algorithm to produce a global driving score reflecting the emission level for various pollutants. Relations with Scores and Aggregate emission has been derived using VTT test on a Ford Fiesta Gasoline engine vehicle. This algorithm has been described in [22] in details, and the main findings useful for the impact assessment are recalled in the following figures. The results are in the form of linear relationships between the score and the aggregate emissions (a weighted combination of NOx, PMs and Carbons emissions, see Figure 14), the fuel consumption (Figure 15), and the PMs respectively (Figure 16). These equations can be used to estimate the emissions from the road trials as the score is computed for every second of driving data. The observed reduction in scores before and after using the MODALES App gives us estimates of the emissions reduction by applying the Okan University formulas. Aggregate emissions reduction is used to estimate the reduction CO, while the dedicated formulas from Figure 15 and Figure 16   18). These results have been used as inputs for COPERT simulations for the following countries: Finland (Helsinki results), Spain (Barcelona results), Turkey (Istanbul results) and Italy (Bergamo results). One can note that Istanbul results are negative, which is contradictory with the trial tests from VTT which did not stated any increasing NOx emissions, even for petrol cars. The presence of a high prevalence of petrol cars in the Istanbul vehicles trial fleet may explain this increase in NOx emissions, reductions being mostly associated with diesel vehicles. Instead of an emission increase for NOx for Turkey, it has been decided to use a null value for the lower scenario, stating that no reduction in NOx is expected for this country, even for diesel vehicles. For CO, CO 2 , and PM emissions, the observed reduction in scores for every test sites (see Figure 17 For Turkey, results from the trial tests are greater than the VTT results for the CO2 emissions reduction. The Nanjing test site was devoted to study the impact of MODALES training on buses driving behaviour. For safety reasons, it was not possible for them to use the MODALES App while driving. The obtained results reflect only the change due to the training. It was not possible to derive a lower scenario for the buses case. Instead, 0% emissions reduction are used as inputs, which equivalent to not having the MODALES solution onboard. The observed reduction for the buses in Nanjing has been used for the upper scenario of all the 6 countries considered. Using COPERT requires several kinds of inputs already described in the previous section. Among those inputs, the main requirement is the description of the national vehicles stock, segregated by engine type (Petrol, diesel, hybrid or electric) and by European standards (Table 13). Such information can be extrapolated at the European level for a fixed year, see for example [23], but it is a more complex task to get it for every European country. As stated by [24], only four countries (Germany, Spain, Finland and Italy) report on the combination of age class and engine type. As Euro standards are derived from the age of the vehicles, it is a challenge to obtain the needed data from any known source. Moreover, as the impact assessment needs to extrapolate the stock into the future, it is not only necessary to know the stock by engine type and euro standards, but also to know it over the past years, and in the future. Indeed, the evolution of the stock profile, segregated by Euro standard and ZEV uptake, plays a critical role in the emission reduction potential and associated health benefits [25]. After a careful analysis of the available data, authors had to face the evidence that such data is not available publicly anywhere, and that a dedicated model had to be developed. A literature review reveals that complex models have been developed in specific cases ( [26], [27]), but they are used to study long term impacts (2040-2050) of planned policies on the share of driving technologies. The MODALES solutions can be seen as transition solutions, temporarily effective until the target of a market dominated by electric vehicles is reached. Is it therefore not relevant to use such models as our target is the year 2025. Moreover, such models are developed for the national or regional level and cannot be extrapolated to other countries. A simpler and generalisable methodology has been settled-up to tackle this issue starting from harmonised and quality checked data from the Eurostat website. The sections below are describing in detail the proposed approach to estimate the evolution of the stock based upon the available data from Eurostat website. Several European countries are maintaining national statistics about the stock evolution, but various drawbacks are associated with such initiatives: firstly, the data may not be accessible easily for researchers from another country, and secondly, the data may not use the reference categories as the European standards. For example, in France, such data exists but it mixes the engine type with the \"Critair\" segmentation (national categorisation of vehicles emissions) instead of the Euro standards, and it is not straightforward to set up the link between the two. Several other European countries are not providing any data, and Eurostat data is likely to be the most exhaustive resource available that time. Even within Eurostat data, several parts are missing or have not been transmitted by some countries. Due to this reason, it was not possible to compute the impact of MODALES solutions to all the relevant countries in which the trial test took place. The following countries have been considered: Finland, Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Germany. Luxembourg, Greece, and Great Britain have too much missing data to reconstruct the stock across the years. France and Germany have been added to the list despite the absence of test trials in these countries, but because their stock of vehicles are the biggest in Europe. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 The following files from Eurostat data [28] are used as inputs to our model: The main idea underlying the reconstruction procedure is simple: For each year N, the vehicle stock at the end of the year is equal to the stock at the end of year N-1, plus the newly registered vehicles at year N, minus the vehicles out of the stock. This relationship can be expressed using the following equation: Historical stock data is available from Eurostat, but we would like to rebuild it until 2021 (last year of Eurostat data) step by step in order to: 1. Allocate the newly registered vehicles to the corresponding Euro standard. a. This is done using official Euro standard date of first registration given in Table 13. b. For light commercial & trucks before 2013, the following convention is adopted: 75% of vehicles are attributed to Euro IV (4), and 25% to Euro V(5). Indeed, Euro V standard started in 2008, far beyond the oldest available data from Eurostat (2013). 2. Suppress the vehicles out of the stock from the correct Euro standard. a. The adopted convention is that when X vehicles are out of the stock, they are subtracted first from the oldest category still in circulation, and then the following when it is empty. Also, we would like to be able to estimate the stock for the future until year 2025. In order to reach our goals, it is necessary to estimate the number of vehicles out of the stock every year, and estimate it for the future years. The vehicles out of the stock at year N can be estimated using the historical data, using the following equation: Given the values of out_of_stock, stock & registrations are available for each year, it is straightforward to estimate the stock share of Euro standards by performing the previous steps 1 and 2. To extrapolate the stock share across Euro standards in the future, it is needed to estimate the stock, the registrations, and the vehicles out of stock for the needed years. This is done using a simple linear model fitted over the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Registration data reflects interesting trends: diesel passenger cars are constantly decreasing for all countries, while petrol ones are still increasing. Electric passenger cars show an increasing trend for Germany and France, while their number is still low for the other countries. The differences in trend across countries reflect different policies. As an example, petrol light commercial vehicles are decreasing in Germany, while their number still increase for all the other countries. When aggregated, it is clear that diesel vehicles stock is stable, except for France which as recent policy reducing the incentives to by such vehicles. Electric vehicles stock is increasing for all countries, but the trends are much greater for Germany and France. Petrol vehicles stock is stable, with small increases for Germany and France. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 This chapter provides the results obtained for both the vehicle stock share estimation across Euro standards and the COPERT simulations before & after the MODALES solution. Apart from the inputs parameters derived from MODALES trails, the stock share across Euro standards plays a significant roles in national level emissions estimation. Various situations exist across European countries, and MODALES solutions impact is likely to be different. For each country, the results are provided using two graphs and one table. The first graph presents the European standard share evolution from 2010 to 2025. The second graph presents the results of COPERT simulations for year 2025, together with a table containing the same results in a numerical form. Firstly, detailed results per country are presented, then a global analysis is performed at the final section of this chapter. Finland stock of vehicles is characterised by a domination of old Euro 4 vehicles (57% in 2025, see Figure 22), with low penetration rates of most recent Euro standards. Results of the COPERT simulations are presented graphically (Figure 23) and numerically ( The Italian share of European standards is comparable to Spain, with a greater proportion of Euro 6d standards (22%). The stock is a bit newer than the Spanish one, and much newer than the Finnish one. Obtained emissions for CO are greater than Spain, ranging from 9.4% to 53.6%, while CO2 emissions reduction are ranging from 3.3% to 7%. NOx emissions are obtained from the combination of the three MODALES solutions, from 7.1% for the lower scenario to 33.8% for the upper scenario. PMs emissions are reduced from 1.4% for the lower scenario up to 4.4% for the upper scenario. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023  Due to the greater proportion of newer vehicles than for the previous countries, benefits from the App and training are less than previously observed. CO emissions range from 4.1% up to 36.1%, while CO2 expected reduction is between 1.8% and 3.1%. NOx reductions could be expected to lie between 6.6% and 25.1% thanks to the three MODALES solutions, with no effect of the App and training (see comments about this situation in the previous chapter). For PMs, reductions are between 1.6% (PM10, lower) and 5.1% (PM2. France's share of Euro standard (Figure 30) is similar to the Turkish one, except that proportions of Euro 6d is about 24% (17.6% for Turkey). Very few benefits are expected from this category of vehicles as their emissions are already low compared to the other standards. Therefore, savings up to 59.6% could be expected for CO emissions, but only 5.2% in the more realistic lower scenario. CO2 savings range from 3.8 to 4.2%, in line with other countries. NOx emissions reductions range from 6.9% up to 39.4%. For PMs, reductions range from 1.1% (PM10, lower), up to 3.8% (PM2.5, upper). One can notice that PM reductions are mostly the result of antitampering measures, while retrofits have a very low impact on all the pollutants. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023  Germany's results (Figure 33) are similar to France, in the sense that benefits from the App and training could reach very high levels due to the large fleet of passenger cars. CO emissions reduction ranges from 5.3% to 60.2%, the upper reduction among all the studied countries. CO2 reductions are consistent with previous results, ranging from 4.3% to 3.8%. It could be noticed that the MODALES impacts on PM emissions are under 1%, which is the minimum observed among the studied countries. This is due to the very low penetration rate of Euro 4 vehicles in Germany, which is the category of vehicles for which the impacts of retrofit is greatest. Finally, NOx emissions show great potential for reduction, as they range from 6.3% up to 36.2%, with an important impact from anti tampering measures (between 3.5% and 7.4% It is important to extract the deep tendencies of the previous national results, as it helps understanding the underlying process of emissions reduction and how it could be influenced by individual country situations, the actual and predicted stock of vehicles for example. A summary of the results is presented in Figure 34 below. This provides, in the same form as Figure 3 in section 2.5, the range of emissions reductions from the lower scenario (pessimistic) to the upper one (optimistic). Also, this figure provide the estimates obtained by MODALES previous works at the individual level and already explained in previous deliverables ( [1], [2]). For the reader interested in tonnes of pollutants saved according to the MODALES solutions, for every pollutant and for every scenario, a table summarising the savings in tonnes and the corresponding percentage of reduction is provided (Table 20). For a global analysis of the results, please refer to chapter 7. MODALES D6. 4 This chapter presents the results of the three surveys conducted among trial participants. First, the app built for the MODALES needs is presented, together with its functionalities. Then, the questionnaire itself is detailed, together with the choices made in order to improve response rate. Finally, the results are discussed in a later section. Guidelines for low-emission driving and technical requirements for a smartphone application were developed under the MODALES WP5 [22], taking into consideration the results from WP2, WP3 and WP4 activities. The MODALES app, a personal driving assistant implementing both real-time (active) and passive (report after each trip) recommendations to reduce emissions levels (linked to the MODALES impact 1 and 2), was developed and tested in WP6. Together with an online video training, its aim was to impact driving style and reduce pollutant emissions (MODALES solution 2: app and training). Impacts on the powertrain emissions, brake emissions and tyre emissions before and after using the MODALES app and training were tested. Because the app was used in conjunction with the training their impacts were measured together during the pilot trials. The MODALES app aimed to assist drivers throughout their journeys by providing recommendations that do not interfere with their driving (e.g., when stationary at a traffic light or in the form of sound notifications). The app had three separate modules: • A data collection module, which considered data from (a) OBD-II (e.g., engine rpm, vehicle speed), (b) phone sensors (e.g., accelerometer, wireless traces) and (c) the user. Using an OBD dongle was optional, this allowed end-users to use either a standalone application or one which relied on additional data. The lack of data induced by the absence of OBD lead to less data collected for the project's impact analysis, but still valid. Phones were, if possible, fixed in the car using a car holder, allowing the user to have a comfortable view of the phone's interface and for the proper recording of accelerometric data, i.e., using a stable reference in space. Ideally, the phones should have been positioned vertically, but the system also worked horizontally. • The data mentioned above was used as input to two scoring modules, enabling the creation of a local representation of the user's profile and distinguishing of different driving behaviours previously identified via laboratory tests and state-of-the-art reviews. These scoring modules computed, on one side, a real-time acceleration profile, and on the other side, a time series of scores, using a classification approach. Input data came from OBD dongle and phone sensors, while ground truth data was provided by the user and independent data such as GPS. • Finally, a recommendation module advised the user to adopt attitudes depending on their perceived driving behaviour. Based on the two sub-scores explained above, the mobile app generated two types of recommendations: • Active recommendations were presented to the user while driving. The user's driving style was analysed in real-time and transcribed into an acceleration score. Active recommendations required local data processing and storage. The user interface and possible interactions actions needed to be limited to preserve the user's safety. It was aimed to keep these recommendations simple. • Passive recommendations were given to the user after a trip. An end of trip report was generated, including textual recommendations, statistical analyses, and MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 contextual elements. This feedback aimed to allow drivers to learn from bad driving habits and improve their emissions reduction. Passive recommendations meant that data processing and storage was outsourced to an external server. The mobile app was developed in two different versions: the first only for data collection and the second with the full scoring and recommendation systems. Three surveys were conducted among the MODALES trial participants. The first was the driver selection survey (included as an annex to MODALES D6.2 -Trial Management), which was administered individually by each participating project partner (site leader) to collect basic information such as vehicle type, age group, gender, driving experience and typical driving intensity (annual mileage, main trip purposes). These allowed the volunteer drivers to be selected, and this data provides context to the data analysis which is reported in Deliverable D6.3. The second survey followed the viewing of the training video by each participant and their move to Phase 2 of the trial. This focused on their understanding and acceptance of the video, the extent to which they learnt things and any other feedback. This is reported in MODALES D6.2 -Trial Management. This chapter reports on the final survey, after the end of Phase 2 of the trials, which covered the use of the MODALES app and the extent to which drivers felt their driving style and behaviour had changed as a result of the MODALES training video and the MODALES app advice and feedback. This survey used the EUSurvey online tool18 , for consistency with the second survey and to enable different language versions of the questionnaire. It was kept as short as possible (average response time 5-10 minutes) in order to elicit a satisfactory response rate. For two types of poor (high emitting) driving behaviour, it asked whether the user carried out this behaviour before taking the training and whether they now carry on with the same behaviour, they have modified (improved) a little, or have improved a lot (avoiding almost always this kind of poor behaviour). Alternatively, they already avoided poor behaviour and continue to do so after the training and using the app. The situations were: • Speeding up when the engine is cold; • Rapid accelerations, which might lead to a need for sudden braking. The questionnaire asked how regularly the driver used the app during the trial period (most or all trips, around half of trips, or only a few). For occasions when the driver did not use the app, they were asked why not (e.g. in a hurry, only a short trip, did not like the app or did not find it useful, had technical/connection problems with the app). It asked how the user reacted to real-time on-trip feedback from the app (simple colour changes), and also how they reacted to the post-trip feedback. Finally, this questionnaire recognised that some drivers had experienced difficulties such as getting the app to connect with the dongle, getting the app to send data, etc., and also reminded them that MODALES is a research project and not a commercial product. However, if this project led to a better performing and more stable version of this app being available, and available for free, it asked whether MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 they would use it. They were also asked for any other suggestions for improvements to the MODALES app. The MODALES app was trialled by approximately 200 volunteer drivers at 8 pilot sites in the following cities: Barcelona, Spain; Bergamo, Italy; Helsinki, Finland; Istanbul, Turkey; Leeds, United Kingdom; Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Thessaloniki, Greece and Nanjing, China. An anonymised feedback questionnaire on the MODALES app was sent to the volunteer drivers. A total of 69 responses were recorded from drivers in pilot sites in Finland, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. These responses are the subject of the following analysis. All the pilot site countries (except for China which performed a different analysis) were represented in the questionnaire responses. Turkey and the UK had the most responses whereas Italy and Luxemburg had the least. If we consider 69 respondents from the 7 countries, an average of 10 responses per country was received. Close to three-quarters of respondents were male (51), 16 were female, 2 n/a (see Figure 35). The age group most represented among respondents was the 30-49-year-old bracket (40), followed by the 50-64-year-old bracket ( 16), the 21-29-year-old bracket (11) and finally the 65-74-year-old bracket (2) (see Figure 36).  32 respondents used the MODALES app every time or most times they drove during the trial period. 22 respondents used the app around half the time they drove during the trial period. 15 respondents used the app only a few times during the trial period (see Figure 38). Several behavioural changes were encouraged by the MODALES app and training. Respondents were therefore asked about changes in their driving behaviour before and after the use of the MODALES app. One behaviour being targeted was the act of speeding up when the engine is cold. A total of 45 respondents reported no change in behaviour following the use of the MODALES app (see Figure 39). Of those 45, 40 respondents were already avoiding strong acceleration or high speeds with a cold engine and continued to do so. The remaining 5 respondents continued to accelerate or drive fast with a cold engine. Importantly, 24 out of the 29 respondents who used to accelerate or drive fast with a cold engine reported behaviour change, with 18 respondents doing so less often after the trial, and 6 respondents avoiding doing so altogether. MODALES D6. Reports of behaviour change with regards to rapid acceleration which might lead to a sudden need for breaking was roughly similar as the above (see Figure 40). 44 respondents reported no change in behaviour, with 43 of them paying attention to traffic situations to avoid rapid or sudden acceleration prior to using the MODALES app. 18 respondents reported a change in behaviour resulting from the use of the MODALES app, stating that they now consider certain traffic situations and accelerate less, to avoid breaking suddenly. Reaction to real-time on-trip feedback from the app (simple colour changes from green to yellow, orange, or red): 24 (more than one third) reduced acceleration or drove more slowly in some cases, 17 (one fourth) either reduced acceleration or drove more slowly in most or all cases, 16 (one fourth) reported not reacting or change driving style as a result of the on-trip feedback from the app (see Figure 41). Finally, 11 respondents reported having another reaction that the three options provided (reduced acceleration in some or all cases, or no change). The comments provided by respondents in relation to the real-time on-trip feedback are very informative. A number reported that this function of the app did not work for them -that they did not see any colour changes for example. A number did not understand why the colour changed and as a MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 result did not know how to adapt behaviour to respond to the prompt. A number thought the feedback was slow. A significant number reported that the feedback often seemed linked to irregularities in the road surface or obstacles on the road (such as traffic lights, zebra crossings or speed bumps) rather than their driving. Thought the app barely reacted to acceleration or aggressive driving. A number are reporting that the app did not work. Reaction to post-trip feedback from the app: 26 reported adapting their driver behaviour according to the post-trip recommendations in some cases, 18 reported doing so in most or all cases (see Figure 42). 15 reported no reaction or change in driving style resulting from the post-trip feedback. 9 respondents gave another reaction, 8 of whom stated they did not receive any post-trip feedback and one stating that they did not have time to consult the post-trip feedback. Drivers were asked if a better performing and more stable version of the app were available for free if they would use it (see Figure 43). 63 out of 69 respondents were willing to use the app in some of the following ways: 35 respondents mentioned they would install and use it with a dongle, 19 of which said they would use it on most or all journeys, 16 of which said they would only on some occasions (such as long journeys). 9 respondents stated they would use the app but would not use the dongle. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 18 respondents would only use it if the system were integrated into the dashboard of the vehicle and not on the phone. Finally, six respondents were not interested in using such an application, even if it were integrated into the vehicle and worked perfectly. A significant number of other responses and feedback was provided to this question of future use. These responses raised several important issues with the design and functionality of the app (such as its distractive qualities and its lack of clarity). Respondents highlighted mainly three categories of issues relating to: the real-time feedback feature, the interference of the MODALES app with their use of other apps (such as a maps or GPS app), the connection of the app with the OBD or dongle. With regards to issues with real time feedback, some respondents suggested that in addition to the colour change that there be hints towards to reason for the colour change to better understand the reason for the change. A few commented on the distractive nature of real-time feedback, with one respondent suggesting that only post-trip feedback be provided. Another respondent suggested that MODALES app features be integrated into the dashboard of the vehicle. With regards to the use of the MODALES app conflicting with the use of other apps, respondents suggested features to remedy this, such as: a floating window or widget, notification pop-ups, split screen. With regards to issues with the connection of the app to the OBD/dongle, a respondent suggested to include an indicator for the dongle/OBD connection in the active display. Another respondent suggested that the app (working with the dongle) provide a failure code explanation to the driver. Finally, a respondent asked that there be a more efficient delivery of technical support for issues relating to the application. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 The transportation sector is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing these emissions has become a priority for many governments and organisations. One approach to reducing emissions is through the use of anti-tampering regulation measures and retrofit campaigns for older vehicles. MODALES impact assessment results have shown that the older the vehicle stock, the more savings can be expected from these measures. This is because older vehicles are often less fuel efficient and emit more pollutants than newer models. By retrofitting these vehicles with newer technology and implementing anti-tampering measures, emissions can be reduced and fuel efficiency can be improved. However, the effectiveness of these measures varies depending on the type of vehicle and the country in question. For example, countries with older vehicle stocks may see greater benefits from retrofit campaigns, while countries with newer stocks may see limited or no impact. Similarly, the potential savings from anti-tampering measures may be greater in some countries than in others. Another approach to reducing emissions is through behaviour-related changes, such as improving driving habits. MODALES impact assessment results have shown that there is significant potential for savings through app-based solutions and training programs that encourage more efficient driving. However, these solutions may not be as effective as OEM embedded systems, which are typically more expensive but also more efficient. Overall, the research suggests that there is significant potential for reducing emissions in the transportation sector through a combination of anti-tampering measures, retrofit campaigns, and behaviour-related changes. However, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of vehicle, the country in question, and the specific technology used. As such, a targeted and nuanced approach will be necessary to achieve meaningful reductions in emissions. Considering the feedback questionnaire analysis conducted among MODALES trial participants, the final survey focused on the use of the MODALES app and the extent to which drivers felt their driving style and behaviour had changed. The survey recorded 69 responses from volunteer drivers in pilot sites across seven countries. The majority of the respondents drove combustion engine vehicles, and around one-third of them used the app every time they drove during the trial period. The survey revealed that the app successfully encouraged behavioural changes in driving, with many respondents reporting a reduction in poor driving behaviour. However, several issues were raised with the app's design and functionality, particularly in relation to real-time feedback, interference with other apps, and connection with the OBD dongle. Respondents suggested several features to remedy these issues, including integration with the vehicle dashboard and more efficient technical support. Overall, the survey showed that a better performing and more stable version of the app would be welcomed by most respondents.

This relationship can be expressed using the following equation: Historical stock data is available from Eurostat, but we would like to rebuild it until 2021 (last year of Eurostat data) step by step in order to: 1. Allocate the newly registered vehicles to the corresponding Euro standard. a. This is done using official Euro standard date of first registration given in Table 13. b. For light commercial & trucks before 2013, the following convention is adopted: 75% of vehicles are attributed to Euro IV (4), and 25% to Euro V(5). Indeed, Euro V standard started in 2008, far beyond the oldest available data from Eurostat (2013). 2. Suppress the vehicles out of the stock from the correct Euro standard. a. The adopted convention is that when X vehicles are out of the stock, they are subtracted first from the oldest category still in circulation, and then the following when it is empty. Also, we would like to be able to estimate the stock for the future until year 2025. In order to reach our goals, it is necessary to estimate the number of vehicles out of the stock every year, and estimate it for the future years. The vehicles out of the stock at year N can be estimated using the historical data, using the following equation: Given the values of out_of_stock, stock & registrations are available for each year, it is straightforward to estimate the stock share of Euro standards by performing the previous steps 1 and 2. To extrapolate the stock share across Euro standards in the future, it is needed to estimate the stock, the registrations, and the vehicles out of stock for the needed years. This is done using a simple linear model fitted over the years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Registration data reflects interesting trends: diesel passenger cars are constantly decreasing for all countries, while petrol ones are still increasing. Electric passenger cars show an increasing trend for Germany and France, while their number is still low for the other countries. The differences in trend across countries reflect different policies. As an example, petrol light commercial vehicles are decreasing in Germany, while their number still increase for all the other countries. When aggregated, it is clear that diesel vehicles stock is stable, except for France which as recent policy reducing the incentives to by such vehicles. Electric vehicles stock is increasing for all countries, but the trends are much greater for Germany and France. Petrol vehicles stock is stable, with small increases for Germany and France.

Also, this figure provide the estimates obtained by MODALES previous works at the individual level and already explained in previous deliverables ( [1], [2]). Results shows that the older the vehicle stock, the more savings can be expected from the MODALES proposed solutions. This is because older vehicles are often less fuel efficient and emit more pollutants than newer models. By retrofitting these vehicles with newer technology and implementing antitampering measures, emissions can be reduced and fuel efficiency can be significantly improved at the country level. However, the effectiveness of these measures varies depending on the type of vehicle and the country in question. For example, countries with older vehicle stocks may see greater benefits from retrofit campaigns, while countries with newer stocks may see limited or no impact. Similarly, the potential savings from anti-tampering measures may be greater in some countries than in others. Results also shows that there is significant potential for savings through app-based solutions and training programs that encourage more efficient driving. However, these solutions may not be as effective as OEM embedded systems, which are typically more expensive but also more efficient, particularly on the long term. Overall, the research suggests that there is significant potential for reducing emissions in the transportation sector through a combination of anti-tampering measures, retrofit campaigns, and behaviour-related changes. However, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of vehicle, the country in question, and the specific technology used. As such, a targeted and nuanced approach will be necessary to achieve meaningful reductions in emissions. The MODALES trial conducted three surveys among its participants. The final survey focused on the use of the MODALES app and the extent to which drivers felt their driving style and behaviour had changed. The survey recorded 69 responses from volunteer drivers in pilot sites across seven countries. Majority of the respondents drove combustion engine vehicles, and around one-third of them used MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 the app every time they drove during the trial period. The survey revealed that the app successfully encouraged behavioural changes in driving, with many respondents reporting a reduction in poor driving behaviour. However, several issues were raised with the app's design and functionality, particularly in relation to real-time feedback, interference with other apps, and connection with OBD/dongle. Respondents suggested several features to remedy these issues, including integration with the vehicle dashboard and more efficient technical support. Overall, the survey showed that a better performing and more stable version of the app would be welcomed by most respondents. Finally, this deliverable is an essential component of Work Package 6 of the MODALES project, which highlights the effectiveness of implementing low emission driving behaviours and proper vehicle maintenance practices. The results provide valuable information to decision makers, stakeholders, and researchers in their efforts to achieve zero air pollution from road vehicles. 1. Introduction" ;

On the one hand, improvement of knowledge on the factors affecting emissions will be among experts and by guidelines, while the behavioural change promoted by MODALES project will focus on the enduser, in terms of both proper vehicle maintenance (including anti-tampering and retrofitting) and the driving style for lower emissions. Many studies found that the majority of car users are unaware of the influence of their driving habits and other actions on the emissions they create. Also, motorists in general do not pay much attention to exhaust emissions, as they are mostly not visible and easily ignored, as are brake and tyre emissions. Hence, MODALES aims to make users more aware of these issues and, at the same time, to address behaviour that can lead to higher emissions, such as careless driving habits and lack of maintenance, or even purposeful tampering of the emissions control systems. Therefore, the goal of MODALES is to address the challenges of, on one hand, enhancing low-emission practices and, on the other hand, suppressing high-emission behaviours, through two main domains of knowledge: the Vehicle domain, and the Driving domain." ;

MODALES has developed a dedicated app that incorporates several algorithms specifically developed within the project and used as a basis for immediate feedback. This solution combines two actions: firstly, a short training course that can be followed remotely thanks to a video, and secondly, an app companion that provides simple, immediate feedback and advice after the journey. The combination of these two features is expected to have an impact on different types of emissions. The experimental protocol of the adopter did not allow the results to be split between these two features. The proposed impact assessment follows the same approach as the previous two solutions: a lower and an upper scenario are designed. The extrapolation of pollutant emissions is always challenging, as their measurement requires special and expensive tools such as PEMS (Portable Emission Measurements). Only the road tests carried out by VTT (Finland) benefit from such a precise measurement tool. Although very accurate and informative, these tests suffer from a lack of representativeness for the following reasons: Firstly, only 6 drivers drove the instrumented cars, and secondly, the route was always the same, mixing traffic conditions, but certainly not representative of the average conditions of a European driver. Despite these drawbacks, the results are the only accurate measurements available. They are available in Table 7. It can be assumed that the drivers were in an optimal condition to apply the training course carefully. The laboratory conditions, i.e. driving an instrumented car together with a technician, are known to be a favourable condition for the subjects' compliance with the experimenter's expected wishes. Based on this knowledge, the VTT results are used as parameters for the upper scenario. MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023" ;

        nif:anchorOf              "MODALES developed innovation solutions to address the complex issues explained above, that are divided into four main areas: drivers and their driving behaviour, retrofits that enable emissions to be reduced, the EOBD that enables to malfunctioning to be notified, and inspections to detect poorly maintained and tampered vehicles. The innovation solutions from MODALES could be transformed into practical solutions, ready to be implemented by European countries. All these forms of actions should affect direct or indirect emissions, but through different process. From the detailed technical studies from MODALES partners, and from studies about European national regulations, three main practical solutions are proposed, and their potential impacts tested through scenarios built upon MODALES trial tests and studies results: The first solution consists of a regulation policy to detect poorly maintained and tampered vehicles that can be summarised by the two following measures. • Mandatory tampering detection using OBD (On-Board Diagnostic systems) data during Periodic Technical Inspections; The impact of this solution is done by estimating the proportion of vehicles for which retrofit is relevant based on MODALES cost benefits analyses [1] . The third solution is a mobile app for low-emission driving that aims to assist drivers throughout their journeys by providing recommendations that do not interfere with their driving. The feedback allows drivers to learn from bad driving habits and improve their emissions reduction. Together with an online training (videos available in the Media section of the MODALES website: https://modalesproject.eu/media, supported by an awareness campaign with low-emission driving tips, here: https://modales-project.eu/campaign), the app is assumed to impact the driving style and generate benefits on pollutant emissions. The combined impact of the app and the training is evaluated through the experimental and large scale trial tests results conducted within MODALES. The proposed methodology for Impact assessment is based on the COPERT software, which is used to compare baseline vehicle emissions for some European countries (Finland, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Germany, and France) with the estimated emissions after the implementation of MODALES solutions. It specifically measures the emission savings by estimating air pollutant emissions and greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles for the following pollutants: CO2, CO, NOx, and PM. In fact, COPERT is the EU standard vehicle emissions calculator. It requires detailed data as inputs, such as stock configuration share across EU standards, energy type and vehicle type. Such a level of precision is usually not available from EU countries, so MODALES developed an alternative estimation algorithm based on Eurostat open data sets to estimate the year 2025 situation. Among all the countries where a MODALES trial took place, only four had a sufficient amount of data to reconstruct the stock until the Euro 4 standard, starting in 2011. For the China it was difficult to find historical data from 2011 and the proposed methodology could not therefore be applied. For each Innovation Solution, assumptions are made based on literature survey or MODALES results and experts' knowledge. These assumptions are used to build different scenarios. First, a \"lower\" scenario is built based on a pessimistic assumption, then an optimistic scenario is built and called \"upper\". These scenarios are then translated into a set of quantitative assumptions on the emissions that are suitable to be used as an input parameter into COPERT software, through the \"Vehicle performance improvement\" parameter box (see details Figure 11, page 31). The baseline performances are estimated using the evolution of the vehicles fleet share across Euro standards for each studied country. A simple reconstruction method is proposed: Eurostat data is used to rebuild the share of Euro standards starting from year 2010, up to the year 2021. Missing data are extrapolated linearly when necessary, and the future evolution of the stock until 2025 is estimated by extending the linear trend over the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021.

Relations with Scores and Aggregate emission has been derived using VTT test on a Ford Fiesta Gasoline engine vehicle. This algorithm has been described in [22] in details, and the main findings useful for the impact assessment are recalled in the following figures. The results are in the form of linear relationships between the score and the aggregate emissions (a weighted combination of NOx, PMs and Carbons emissions, see Figure 14), the fuel consumption (Figure 15), and the PMs respectively (Figure 16). These equations can be used to estimate the emissions from the road trials as the score is computed for every second of driving data. The observed reduction in scores before and after using the MODALES App gives us estimates of the emissions reduction by applying the Okan University formulas. Aggregate emissions reduction is used to estimate the reduction CO, while the dedicated formulas from Figure 15 and Figure 16   18). These results have been used as inputs for COPERT simulations for the following countries: Finland (Helsinki results), Spain (Barcelona results), Turkey (Istanbul results) and Italy (Bergamo results). One can note that Istanbul results are negative, which is contradictory with the trial tests from VTT which did not stated any increasing NOx emissions, even for petrol cars. The presence of a high prevalence of petrol cars in the Istanbul vehicles trial fleet may explain this increase in NOx emissions, reductions being mostly associated with diesel vehicles. Instead of an emission increase for NOx for Turkey, it has been decided to use a null value for the lower scenario, stating that no reduction in NOx is expected for this country, even for diesel vehicles. For CO, CO 2 , and PM emissions, the observed reduction in scores for every test sites (see Figure 17 For Turkey, results from the trial tests are greater than the VTT results for the CO2 emissions reduction." ;

This is often done to cut costs by avoiding repair expenses for malfunctions, consumables, and for performance tuning. To address this issue, MODALES partners proposed an information system, the Information System for Vehicle Anti-tampering as shown in Figure 2: Workflow of the proposed Information System for Vehicle Anti-tampering, that can identify and notify possible tampering or insufficient engine maintenance problems, as well as higher engine horsepower of a vehicle. The objective of this system is to protect the environment and improve the air quality. By detecting and addressing these issues, we can ensure that the EATS system is functioning effectively and efficiently, and that the emissions are within the acceptable limits. This will not only benefit the environment but also promote sustainable transportation practices. The most common tampering techniques are the following: • The most common method is to disable the EGR or DPF system; • ECU re-flashing: Alters the ECU flash and perform checks using test drives or dyno tests; MODALES D6.4 Impact Assessment Version 2.0 Date 28/06/2023 • Emulators: Devices that attack the SCR system; • Modifiers: Hardware solutions that are simpler to emulators and aim to alter the control state of an EATS; • OBD Suppressors: These devices sent specific CAN-bus messages to suppress the on-board diagnostics of the vehicle. This Information System based on OBD Data is designed to enhance the security of vehicles by leveraging data from the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) system. The system architecture consists of a mobile phone application that receives vehicle data through an OBDLink MX+ dongle device. The data is then transmitted to a server for processing, transformation, and loading into a database. The server also implements data analytics and generates notifications based on the analysis. The website presents the aggregated data in an easy-to-understand format. The system is designed to ensure that any tampering with the vehicle is detected and reported promptly. The OBD system provides real-time data on the vehicle's performance, which can be used to detect any anomalies that may indicate tampering. The server processes the data to identify any missing values and transforms it into a format that can be easily analysed. The data analytics component of the system uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data and generate alerts when unusual activity is detected. Overall, the information system is a powerful tool for enhancing the security of vehicles and preventing tampering. The system provides real-time monitoring and analysis of vehicle performance, enabling prompt detection of any anomalies and ensuring that appropriate action can be taken to prevent further damage." ;

Such systems work continuously and their recommendations are applicable in all kinds of situations. According to Amitran recommendations, scaling-up is possible and straightforward when field data is collected through different road types and driving conditions. The impact to be tested are the powertrain emissions, brake emissions and tyre emissions before and after using the MODALES app and training. As the training is to be used in conjunction with the app, they will be measured together (no analysis of app only or training only). The large number of MODALES experiments finely captures the variability of driving behaviour across European countries. The FESTA methodology applied to MODALES research questions provides statistical evidence about the emission reduction across these various conditions, but also on the acceptance of the app and the adoption of recommendations through questionnaires.
