241110	On-grid utility-scale photovoltaic (>1000 kW)				241100	Renewables	On-grid utility-scale photovoltaic are solar photovoltaic systems that produce electricity for the transmission grid and that have the sole economic purpose of producing electricity. As such, this excludes any solar photovoltaic systems that are connected to the transmission or distribution grids and produce net electricity but that have a different economic activity (i.e. an activity other than producing electricity). On-grid utility-scale photovoltaic typically has an installed capacity of 1000 kW or more and is usually located in large open areas like deserts, farmland and lakes.
241120	On-grid distributed photovoltaic (30-1000 kW)				241100	Renewables	On-grid distributed photovoltaic (30-1000  kW) includes solar photovoltaic systems designed for on-site electricity generation and consumption that are typically connected to the distribution grids to sell any excess electricity generated. These systems are typically installed on commercial and public buildings and range in size from 30 kW to less than 1000 kW.
241130	On-grid distributed photovoltaic (<30 kW)				241100	Renewables	On-grid distributed photovoltaic (<30 kW) includes solar photovoltaic systems designed for on-site electricity generation and consumption that are usually connected to the distribution grids to sell any excess electricity generated. These systems are typically installed on residential and other small buildings, and are sized at less than 30 kW.
241200	Off-grid solar photovoltaic				241000	Renewables	Off-grid solar photovoltaic is an aggregate group of off-grid solar photovoltaic systems and technologies that are not connected to a distribution or transmission grid. These subcategories are segmented by type of system or technology, and solar lights (241210), small solar home systems (241220), large solar home systems (241230), and solar mini-grids (241260) also line up with the tiers of electricity access specified by ESMAP (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program) in its Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Access to Electricity.
241210	Solar lights		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1759804	solar lamp | solar lantern | solar light	241200	Renewables	Solar lights, also known as solar-powered lights or solar lamps, are lighting fixtures that (a) use PV solar panels to generate electricity from sunlight and store that electricity in rechargeable batteries and (b) have installed capacities of less than 11 W. They typically consist of a small LED light, a solar panel and rechargeable batteries (Sunmaster, n.d.). Solar lights are designed to be portable and easy to use and can be set up and moved around as needed. They are often used in areas where electricity is not readily available or reliable, and they often provide energy access solutions to rural households.
241220	Small solar home systems				241200	Renewables	A small solar home system, also known as a solar kit, is a stand-alone solar-powered system designed to provide electricity to households in areas with limited or no access to the grid. Small solar home systems typically have a power output of between 11 W and 50 W and include solar panels, a battery bank, a charge controller and an inverter (MicroEnergy International GmbH, 2014).
241230	Large solar home systems				241200	Renewables	Large solar home systems include all solar home systems with an installed capacity greater than 50 W. These systems can typically support larger home appliances, such as refrigerators, fans and televisions. Solar home systems with a capacity greater than 50 W typically include larger solar panels, a larger battery bank, a charge controller and an inverter. Large solar home systems can be helpful for electricity demand in off-grid households, extending beyond basic lighting.
241240	Solar telecom towers				241200	Renewables	Solar telecom towers are solar PV systems designed exclusively to power telecommunication towers in isolated regions that are not connected to the grid, such as those located on mountain hills. Solar telecom towers usually replace or complement the use of diesel generators, which require frequent maintenance and refuelling. In many cases, solar-powered telecom towers can also provide a more stable and consistent source of electricity (Singh and Avikal, 2020), which can help improve the quality and reliability of communication services in remote or off-grid areas (Deevela et al., 2021).
241250	Solar water pumps				241200	Renewables	Solar water pumps are water pumps exclusively powered by electricity from solar panels. Most such pumps have solar panels feeding an electric motor that turns a bore or surface pump. The pump moves underground or stream water to either a storage tank for later water use (reducing the need for energy storage or further pumping of water [CTCN, 2016]) or directly to its required end use.
241260	Solar mini-grids				241200	Renewables	Solar mini-grids are larger solar arrays that connect multiple demand nodes, such as households, creating a small electricity distribution grid. These systems typically comprise a solar array, a battery bank, an inverter and a distribution system (Zajicek, n.d.).
241270	Solar street lamps				241200	Renewables	Solar street lamps are outdoor lighting units entirely powered by solar energy. Typically, they include solar panels, a battery, an LED lamp and a control system. Solar street lamps usually operate at night or during dark weather conditions, using stored electricity from the solar panels. 
241290	Other off-grid solar photovoltaic				241200	Renewables	Other off-grid solar photovoltaic is a category that includes photovoltaic products that provide power for a wide variety of end uses, such as industrial facilities, solar fridges, electrification of schools and clinics, and private commercial developments in the retail and tourism sectors. This category is not exhaustive and represents off-grid photovoltaic products not elsewhere specified.
242000	Solar thermal energy		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303288	solar thermal electric generation | STE	240000	Renewables	Solar thermal energy is an aggregate group that includes concentrated solar power, solar water heating, solar air heating, and other solar thermal energy. 
242100	Concentrated solar power		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q56761669	CSP	242000	Renewables	Concentrated solar power is the production of electricity, and potentially heat, from systems that use lenses or mirrors and tracking devices to concentrate a large area of solar irradiance into a smaller area. These systems operate through heat exchangers that use the concentrated irradiance to heat a working fluid that evaporates water into steam of different pressures. The pressurised steam expands through a turbine, which turns an electricity generator.
242110	Heliostat field collector				242100	Renewables	Heliostat field collectors, or solar tower collectors, are concentrated solar power plants that use a series of mirrors, known as heliostats, to direct sunlight towards a central tower. The tower absorbs the radiative heat from the sunlight, raising the temperature of a thermal fluid, typically molten salts, to up to 2000°C. The heated molten salts transfer heat to water, evaporating it into superheated steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.
242120	Linear Fresnel reflector				242100	Renewables	Linear Fresnel reflectors are concentrated solar power plants that use long, flat, rectangular mirrors (reflectors) with a single-axis sun-tracking mechanism. These mirrors focus solar radiative heat onto fixed receivers (tubes) positioned above them, allowing for greater mirror mobility when tracking the sun. Employing the Fresnel lens effect, the concentrating mirrors are designed with a large aperture and short focal length, reducing the light absorption, volume and mass of the mirror. Multiple receivers are mounted on trackers to adjust the mirror angles for optimal reflection, which lowers costs and enhances system efficiency (Barbón et al., 2021; Pulido-Iparraguirre et al., 2019; Vouros et al., 2019). 
242130	Parabolic dish		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1087850	parabolic reflector | paraboloidal dish | paraboloid collector | paraboloidal reflector | paraboloid dish | parabolic mirror | paraboloidal mirror | parabolic collector | paraboloid mirror | paraboloid reflector | dish reflector | paraboloidal collector | dish collector | dish mirror	242100	Renewables	A parabolic dish comprises a dish-shaped mirror constructed from numerous smaller flat mirrors that focus and concentrate sunlight onto a thermal receiver (tube), often coupled with a solar Stirling engine (Hafez et al., 2017).
242140	Parabolic trough		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2051219		242100	Renewables	A parabolic trough is a type of solar thermal energy system that uses a series of long, curved (parabolic) mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a focal line, where a receiver tube is placed. This design efficiently captures and focuses sunlight, using the geometric properties of the parabolic shape. The mirrors are usually made of glass, with a reflective coating or film to maximise reflectivity. The receiver tube is positioned along the focal line of the parabolic mirrors, absorbing the concentrated sunlight. The receiver tube typically contains a heat transfer fluid, such as synthetic oil, water or molten salts, that absorbs heat and transfers it to water for heating or evaporation into steam (Bellos, 2019), thereby driving a turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. The entire parabolic trough collector assembly is mounted on a tracking system that follows the sun’s movement.
242190	Other concentrated solar power				242100	Renewables	Other concentrated solar power not elsewhere specified.
242200	Solar water heating		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1136659		242000	Renewables	Solar water heating involves converting the radiative thermal energy from sunlight into thermal energy that can be used for domestic water heating. This group is divided into the main thermodynamic processes for solar water heating.
242210	Unglazed solar water heaters				242200	Renewables	Unglazed SWHs use a black mat or a series of black tubes to absorb sunlight and heat water as it circulates through the system. Unglazed SWHs are primarily used for heating outdoor swimming pools and are less efficient than glazed SWHs
242220	Glazed single solar water heaters				242200	Renewables	Glazed single SWHs are solar water heating systems that consist of a solar collector with a transparent glazed cover and, often, an insulated storage tank. The collector is typically made of copper or aluminium and contains a dark absorber plate that absorbs solar radiation heat (Wang et al., 2018).
242230	Glazed combined solar water heaters				242200	Renewables	Glazed combined SWHs are solar water heating systems that consist of more than one solar collector with a transparent glazed cover and, often, one or more insulated storage tanks. By using multiple glazed collectors, the thermal efficiency of water heating increases compared to using a single SWH. The flow dynamics could be vastly different than in single collectors: the heating fluid could flow from one collector to another (connected in series) or it could flow through each collector once and then mix (connected in parallel). 
242240	Concentrated solar water heaters				242200	Renewables	Concentrated SWHs use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight, increasing the intensity of solar irradiance. The concentrated sunlight is then used to heat a fluid, which is typically water used for domestic or industrial purposes. The heated water is stored in an insulated tank and used as needed, and the system may be designed to include backup heating sources in case of cloudy weather. 
242300	Solar air heating		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3446330	solar air heat	242000	Renewables	Solar air heating refers to the use of solar thermal energy to heat air. The heated air can be used for domestic space heating, ventilation heating, industrial process heating or agricultural drying (Solar Air Heating Organization, 2015). Solar air heating systems typically consist of a collector panel, which absorbs sunlight and heats the air, and potentially a mechanism for circulating the heated air into a building or process.
242310	Solar air natural convection heating				242300	Renewables	Solar air natural convection heating refers to the use of solar thermal collectors to heat air, which in turn flows through a thermodynamic system by natural convection. In natural convection, as the solar energy heats the air, the air expands and becomes less dense, rising naturally and flowing up through vents into the space to be heated. As the air cools, it contracts and becomes denser, sinking and returning to the collector to be heated again (NREL, n.d.). This makes solar air natural convection heating an energy-efficient and cost-effective option for heating small spaces with good ventilation (e.g. greenhouses or small rooms) and low space heating demand. 
242320	Solar air forced convection heating				242300	Renewables	Solar air forced convection heating refers to the use of solar thermal collectors to heat air, which in turn flows through a thermodynamic system by forced convection. In forced convection, a compressor pushes air through the solar thermal collectors, which heat the air as it passes through them; the air flows onward to heat a space or reduce the humidity of a space or substance. 
242330	Solar air radiative heating				242300	Renewables	Solar air radiative heating refers to the use of solar radiation to heat a surface, which in turn heats air in contact with the surface, usually in thermal isolation from the environment. Various surfaces can be used, including black-painted metal plates or ceramic tiles, all of which are selected for their high capacity to absorb solar radiation energy. The heated surface is placed in a container with a glass cover, which allows solar radiation to pass through the glass and to the surface material while trapping the heated air inside. This heated air can be used for space heating, industrial process heating, or agricultural drying (NREL and US DOE, 2001).
242900	Other solar thermal energy				242000	Renewables	Other solar thermal energy not elsewhere specified, such as the use of solar cook stoves.
250000	Geothermal energy		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127993		200000	Renewables	Heat energy extracted from the Earth's internal thermal reservoirs
251000	Geothermal heat and power				250000	Renewables	Geothermal heat and power involves electricity generation from geothermal heat in thermal power plants and direct heat use. It excludes energy from ground-source heat pumps and other sources used to improve geothermal heat quality. Geothermal energy provides a constant source of power, making it suitable for baseload power production.
252000	Direct use of geothermal heat				250000	Renewables	Direct use of geothermal heat refers to the heat generated by geothermal heat exchangers mainly used for space heating and cooling (IGA, 2018). 
260000	Bioenergy		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18556	biomass power | bio-energy | biomass energy	200000	Renewables	Energy derived from organic biological materials including wood crops and waste
261000	Solid biofuels		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12059858	solid biofuel	260000	Renewables	Solid biofuels are any solid non-fossil materials of biological origin used solely for energy purposes, including products grown for such purposes and a wide range of residues of biological origin. Solid biofuels are also known as “biomass” and include crops and animal products in the form of solids. Solid biofuels also include secondary energy carriers, like charcoal and biomass pellets and briquettes
261100	Harvested biomass				261000	Renewables	Harvested biomass is an aggregate group that includes wood fuel, energy crops and other harvested biomass. Harvested biomass can be used directly or as a feedstock for various bioenergy applications, including combustion for heat and power generation, compression to make biomass pellets and briquettes, and gasification for liquid and gas biofuel production. Harvested biomass is divided by the type of crop being harvested.
261110	Wood fuel		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1642788		261100	Renewables	Wood fuel refers to the woody biomass derived from trees, when harvested specifically for energy use (see Box 1). It includes wood from the main stem, branches, and other parts of trees (e.g. tops, small branches and twigs, stumps, roots, and bark) so long as they are harvested specifically for fuel. It excludes those other parts of trees if they are produced only as a by-product of logging operations (logging residues) and also excludes trees grown in short-rotation management systems (energy crops). Wood fuel can be removed from the forest in solid form as logs, sticks or bundles of sticks or can be chipped in the forest and removed as wood chips.
261120	Energy crops		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q587926	energy crop	261100	Renewables	Energy crops are other woody or herbaceous plants grown specifically for biofuel production. This category includes trees grown on short rotations (e.g. short-rotation coppice); grasses like miscanthus, switch-grass, and elephant grass; vines like kudzu; and other herbaceous plants (AFWA, 2012). It excludes food crops grown as feedstocks for liquid biofuel production (e.g. maize, sugar cane or oil palm) and crops grown for anaerobic digestion.
261190	Other harvested biomass				261100	Renewables	Other harvested biomass refers to non-wood plant materials taken from the land that have not been planted or managed specifically for energy use but have been harvested for this use. It includes plant materials like bamboo, reed canary grass (Kukk et al., 2011) and invasive weeds with potential energy crop applications. 
261200	Harvest residues				261000	Renewables	Harvest residues are the materials left on cultivated land after harvesting crops or after forestry operations. The harvest residues category is divided by the type of crop group left over after the harvesting or forestry operations. The subcategories are logging residues (e.g. bark, branches) as well as straw and other harvest residues when used for energy purposes. 
261210	Logging residues				261200	Renewables	Logging residues refer to the by-products left in the forest after logging operations. They consist of woody debris from final felling, such as stems, branches, roots, stumps, bark, needles, leaves and twigs, as well as small trees from thinning and clearing operations with unsaleable stem wood. Logging residues can be removed from the forest whole or in bundles but are frequently chipped. Wood chips produced from logging residues are included in this category, but wood chips produced from trees purposely harvested for wood fuel production are excluded (and would be classified as wood fuel [261110]).
261220	Straw		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q160066		261200	Renewables	Straw refers to the dry stalks and other residues of cereal plants (e.g. barley, corn and wheat) that remain after the edible parts of the plant have been removed. All residues of cereal plants left in fields after harvesting should be included in the straw category. This includes the stalks, husks and maize cobs.
261290	Other harvest residues				261200	Renewables	Other harvest residues are any residues left over after harvesting crops, excluding straw and logging residues. These residues can include leaves, stems, roots and other non-edible parts of crops, as well as other agricultural residues.
261300	Biomass processing residues				261000	Renewables	The biomass processing residues category is an aggregate of the by-products obtained during the processing of different types of biomass, such as roundwood or agricultural crops, that have significant energy potential. Many of these residues have non-energy uses (e.g. as feed, mulch or animal bedding or for the production of reconstituted wood panels), so only the share of these residues used for energy should be counted in energy statistics.
261310	Bagasse		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q799856	sugar cane bagasse	261300	Renewables	Bagasse is a fibrous residue material generated during the production of sugar from sugarcane, sorghum or agave. Fresh bagasse typically contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other chemicals, with a moisture content of about 40-50% by weight. Bagasse is mainly used for heat or combined heat and power generation in sugarcane processing facilities, including ethanol production plants. Bagasse can also serve as a primary fuel to be converted into secondary fuels such as biomass pellets and briquettes. The energy from bagasse excludes the energy extracted from the original plants in the form of sugar and the energy produced from the residues of other plants used to make sugar.
261320	Black liquor		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q902245		261300	Renewables	Black liquor is a by-product of the kraft pulping process used in paper production (UNSD, 2018). Black liquor is composed of organic chemicals from wood, as well as inorganic chemicals used in the pulping process. Its main use is as a fuel, and it is classified as a solid biofuel because the organic compounds in the solution are used for energy production and the inorganic chemicals can be recycled into the pulping process. It is a primary source of energy used for electricity generation and heat production, with the possibility of producing other biofuels.
261330	Plant husks		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5187955	crop residue | crop waste	261300	Renewables	Plant husks (or hulls) are the protective coatings of seeds or grains of various plants, such as rice, which protect the seed during its growing season. The husks are formed from hard materials such as silica and lignin. Plant husks may be removed from grains manually, but they are now mostly removed in mills, making mills the main producers of energy from plant husks.
261340	Plant shells				261300	Renewables	Plant shells are the outer coverings of nuts and seeds, such as coconut shells, palm kernel shells and almond shells. They are typically hard, woody and fibrous in texture. Plant shells can be burned and used as a fuel for heat and electricity generation.
261350	Solid wood processing residues				261300	Renewables	Solid wood processing residues are by-products from lumber, plywood, particleboard and other wood product manufacturing. They include materials such as sawmill rejects, slabs, edgings and trimmings, veneer log cores, veneer rejects, sawdust, and residues from carpentry and joinery production (Eurostat et al., 2021). They also include wood chips made from these residues (see Box 1). This category only includes the share of these residues used for energy production and excludes any amounts used for other purposes. These materials are typically collected and repurposed for heat or electricity generation or as feedstocks for biomass pellet production.
261360	Oil plant residues				261300	Renewables	Oil plant residues are the residues left over after the extraction of oil from crops such as olives, sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and palm fruit. The residues are typically high in fats and can be used as a feedstock for biodiesel production or as a source of thermal energy through combustion. This category only includes the share of these residues used for energy production and excludes any amounts used for other purposes. 
261390	Other biomass processing residues				261300	Renewables	Other biomass processing residues include by-products from processing other types of biomass that are used for energy but are not covered by the other specific categories. Such residues include those from the processing of non-woody biomass, such as fruit processing residues (e.g. apple pomace), or those from food processing operations not included in other categories.
261400	Animal residues		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1383944	excrement | animal waste products | animal shit | excreta | metabolic waste | excretes	261000	Renewables	Animal residues refers to the excreta of animals, as well as the residues from meat and fish, that can be used directly as a fuel when dry. The two main categories of animal residue stem from whether the residue is a continued waste product of animals or the actual animal parts themselves. Examples of animal residues include cow dung, poultry litter and fish body parts. These residues can be burned to generate heat and electricity or used as fuel for cooking and heating in households. Animal residues used in anaerobic fermentation plants are excluded from this category; they are included under animal residues biogas (263130).
261410	Manure/dung		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q185716	manure	261400	Renewables	Manure/dung is animal excrement that can be used as a source of energy. It is often used as fuel for heating and cooking in rural areas in numerous countries. Dung is typically collected from livestock, such as cattle, horses and pigs, as well as from poultry, and is often mixed with other organic residue materials, such as straw and crop residues, to improve its energy content and handling characteristics.
261420	Animal processing residues				261400	Renewables	Animal processing residues are the by-products from the slaughter and processing of animals. The use of animal processing residues for energy production can provide economic and environmental benefits by reducing waste disposal costs and providing a source of renewable energy. However, their use must comply with regulations regarding waste disposal and public health.
261490	Other animal residues				261400	Renewables	Other animal residues are any animal residues not covered under the manure/dung or animal processing residues categories. These residues might include feathers, hair, bones or other animal by-products. These residues may have energy potential and, if so, could be burned as a fuel.
261500	Biomass pellets and briquettes				261000	Renewables	Biomass pellets and briquettes are solid and processed biofuels made from dried, cut/crushed and compressed biomass. Wood pellets, created from fuelwood or wood residues, are the most common, but other solid biomass materials such as rice husks, straw, nut shells and renewable municipal waste can also be used. The subdivisions in this group are based on the biomass source used to produce the pellet or briquette, and the quantity of divisions is based on the significance of each energy source. Producing these biofuels involves compressing the biomass or adding a binder, which typically makes up less than 3% of the final weight. These biofuels have low moisture content (below 10%) and high combustion efficiency. Pellets are cylindrical with diameters under 25 mm and lengths under 100 mm; briquettes are also cylindrical but can vary in size.
261510	Wood pellets and briquettes		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q146981	wood pellet | pellet fuel	261500	Renewables	Wood pellets and briquettes are compressed forms of wood biomass, typically made from sawdust, shavings and other wood processing residues, and are often burned for heat and electricity generation. 
261520	Oil cakes		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q513720	press cake | oil cake	261500	Renewables	Oil cakes are the compressed solid residues remaining after the oils are removed from seeds and other agricultural products, resulting in oil plant residues (261360), which are then compressed into cakes. Oil cakes are typically used as animal feed, but when used for energy purposes, they should be considered in this category.
261590	Other biomass pellets and briquettes				261500	Renewables	The other biomass pellets and briquettes category refers to pellets and briquettes made from sources other than wood and oil seeds, such as agricultural residues, energy crops and renewable industrial waste. Examples of other biomass materials used for pellets and briquettes include straw, corn cobs, peanut shells, sunflower and rice husks, and bagasse. These materials are compressed into dense, compact forms that can be used as a source of energy in various applications, including heating, cooking and electricity generation (FAO, 2022).
261600	Charcoal		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177463		261000	Renewables	Charcoal is a secondary solid biofuel obtained through the carbonisation of wood or other vegetable matter in an oxygen-free environment. It mainly consists of carbon, with small amounts of ash and other impurities. Charcoal is typically made from wood (fuelwood and wood residues) but can be made from almost any type of solid biomass.
261900	Other solid biofuels				261000	Renewables	Other solid biofuels includes all solid non-fossil materials of biological origin used for energy that are not counted elsewhere. Where detailed statistics about the use of recovered wood products for energy are available, these amounts can be counted in this category if they are not included in renewable waste (264000).
262000	Liquid biofuels		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12027970	liquid biofuel	260000	Renewables	Renewable liquid fuels from biomass including ethanol biodiesel and bio-jet fuel
262100	Biogasolines		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4914839	biogasoline	262000	Renewables	Biogasolines refer to liquid fuels derived from biomass that could be used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines. This category includes biomethanol, bioethanol (both hydrous and anhydrous), biobutanol, bio-MTBE (methyltertio-butyl-ether) and bio-ETBE (ethyl-tertio-butyl-ether). Each division is based on the chemical composition of the products, irrespective of their use, energy sources or production methods. Bioethanol, bio-ETBE and biobutanol are the most common types of biogasoline.
262110	Biomethanol		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2712765		262100	Renewables	Biomethanol is a one-carbon alcohol (CH3 OH) that is chemically identical to fossil-based methanol. However, the prefix “bio” is used to differentiate it from methanol produced from fossil fuels. Biomethanol is produced from organic matter using different synthesis pathways, most commonly pyrolysis or gasification (Luque et al., 2023).
262120	Bioethanol		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q194361	ethanol fuel	262100	Renewables	Bioethanol is a two-carbon alcohol (C2 H5 OH or CH3 CH2 OH) that can be used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines, serving as a biogasoline. It can be blended with petroleum gasoline in different ratios, ranging from E5 (5% bioethanol and 95% gasoline) to E100 (100% bioethanol). At high concentrations, it is corrosive to conventional engines. The two traditional types of bioethanol are typically referred to as conventional and advanced biogasoline and span three generations10 of bioethanol depending on the feedstock used (see Figure 17).
262130	Biobutanol		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864224	butanol fuel	262100	Renewables	Biobutanol is a four-carbon alcohol (C4 H9 OH or CH3 CH2 CH2 CH2 OH) produced from starch via the acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation pathway (Koutinas et al., 2016). Biobutanol can be used as gasoline in internal combustion engines, serving as a biogasoline. It is chemically identical to the butanol produced from fossil fuels. Among its benefits compared with other biofuels, biobutanol is less hygroscopic, corrosive and volatile (Dürre, 2007), making it easier to store, mix with gasoline at refineries, and transport.
262140	Bio-MTBE				262100	Renewables	Bio-MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) is a chemical compound [C5 H12O, or (CH3 )3 COCH3 ] derived from biomethanol. As a biofuel additive, bio-MTBE can be blended with gasoline to enhance its properties, such as increasing its octane number and reducing its environmental impact (Grippi et al., 2020).
262150	Bio-ETBE				262100	Renewables	Bio-ETBE (ethyl tertiary-butyl ether) is an oxygenate [C6 H14O, or (CH3 )3 CH2 COCH3 ] that serves as a gasoline additive to boost octane rating and decrease engine knocking (Wallace et al., 2009). Bio-ETBE is produced by reacting isobutylene with ethanol, often using bioethanol to qualify for the biofuel credits available in many countries, such as through Brazil’s RenovaBio policy (MF and MP, 2017). This process involves heating the reactants together in the presence of a catalyst, typically an acidic ion exchange resin like AmberLyst (Tretbar et al., 2018).

262200	Biodiesels		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q167947	biodiesel	262000	Renewables	Biodiesels are liquid biofuels derived from biomass and can be used in diesel engines. A wide range of biomass feedstocks, including sugary, starchy, cellulosic materials and algal biomass, could be used to produce biodiesels.
262210	Transesterified biodiesel				262200	Renewables	Transesterified biodiesel, also known as conventional biodiesel, is biodiesel produced through a chemical reaction (transesterification) between an alcohol and the triglycerides found in vegetable oils or animal fats, using a catalyst. Transesterified biodiesel is a linear alkyl ester with a flash point of around 150°C and a density of about 880 kg/m3  (UNSD, 2018). Typically, the process of transesterification combines the oils or fats of biological origin with methanol to produce fatty acid methyl ester and glycerol (Fukuda et al., 2001). Any animal fat or vegetable oil (including inedible oils) can be used to produce transesterified biodiesel, but the most frequently used oils are palm oil, rapeseed (canola) oil and soybean oil. 
262220	Thermal process biodiesel				262200	Renewables	Thermal process biodiesel, or second-generation biodiesel, is produced from the thermal transformation of a biomass feedstock and can be used in diesel engines. As shown in Figure 17, the feedstocks for this biodiesel are cellulose-rich. The production process of this advanced biodiesel involves heating biomass in a low-oxygen environment to create gas through gasification. The synthesis gas, or syngas, is then converted and refined into a liquid biofuel with properties like diesel.
262230	Microalgal biodiesel		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q61136789		262200	Renewables	Microalgal biodiesel or third-generation biodiesel is the liquid biofuel produced by microalgae that can be used in diesel engines. Some microalgae produce up to 70% of lipids in weight by fixating carbon during photosynthesis (Ferreira et al., 2019). Some benefits of this advanced biodiesel include the reduced use of farmland since microalgae live in water, a short growth cycle and high yield, and little competition with human food supply (Zhang et al., 2022).
262240	Straight vegetable oil		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1277761	vegetable oil fuel | PPO | SVO | pure plant oil	262200	Renewables	Straight vegetable oil (SVO), also known as VegOil, waste vegetable oil or virgin vegetable oil, is a type of alternative fuel for diesel engines. The term virgin vegetable oil is sometimes specifically used to refer to unprocessed oils that meet certain quality standards. In many cases, this oil may be used for cooking, and then repurposed for energy uses.
262250	Hydrogenated vegetable oil diesel				262200	Renewables	Hydrogenated vegetable oil diesel, or renewable diesel, is a blend of hydrocarbons that closely resemble petroleum diesel fuel in terms of properties but are derived from biological sources such as animal fats, used cooking oil, and both edible and inedible crops. On average, its hydrocarbon chain is C12H23.

262300	Bio-jet kerosenes				262000	Renewables	Bio-jet kerosene refers to liquid biofuels derived from biomass and blended with or replacing jet kerosene. Commonly, bio-jet kerosene is referred to as sustainable aviation fuel. Bio-jet kerosene can be manufactured from any type of biomass, including plant cellulose and algae. It is produced by a range of thermal processes (including gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or pyrolysis followed by hydrogenation) or by the conversion of sugar to hydrocarbons using micro-organisms such as yeast. Jet fuel is a high-specification fuel that must meet the standards defined in ASTM D1655 for Jet A1 or in the Ministry of Defence Standard 91-91 in the United Kingdom. Bio-jet kerosene must meet these same standards and, in addition, have an ASTM D7566 certification. The ASTM certification procedure is rigorous and can take years and millions of US dollars to complete (IRENA, 2021: 15).
262900	Other liquid biofuels				262000	Renewables	The other liquid biofuels category refers to liquid fuels derived from biomass that are not typically for use in diesel or spark-ignition internal combustion engines or as a substitute for jet kerosene, such as pyrolysis oil. To produce these fuels, thermal processes like gasification are used to convert solid biomass and waste into a range of liquid biofuels with various properties.
262910	Bio-LPG				262900	Renewables	Bio-LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), also known as renewable propane or bio-propane, is a three-carbon alkane (C3 H8 ) produced from renewable feedstocks, including plant and vegetable residues. It is generated through hydrotreatment, which involves reacting vegetable oils or animal fats with hydrogen using a catalyst to produce propane (Johnson, 2019). This process results in a product that has properties equivalent to conventional propane, allowing it to be used in the same applications. It can also be produced biologically, such as through the branched-chain keto acid decarboxylase-dependent pathway (Amer et al., 2020).

263100	Biogas from anaerobic digestion				263000	Renewables	Biogas from anaerobic digestion primarily consists of methane and carbon dioxide (Herout et al., 2011),11 and the subcategories are classified by their biomass feedstock: landfill biogas (263110), wastewater sludge biogas (263120), animal residues biogas (263130), vegetal residues biogas (263140), and other biogases from anaerobic digestion (263190).
263110	Landfill biogas				263100	Renewables	Landfill biogas is produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in landfills. Most landfill biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion, although traces may also come from chemical reactions between waste materials and the evaporation of volatile organic compounds. These landfills must be constructed for the purpose of collecting biogas using pipes or wells built into the sealed landfill (Asgari et al., 2011), but existing landfills could also be retrofitted with a biogas collection system. Any landfill biogas used in the operation of the landfill site (e.g. for treating leachate) should be treated as own-use of energy. Landfill biogas can be further upgraded to biomethane (263310) (Dada and Mbohwa, 2017).
263120	Wastewater sludge biogas				263100	Renewables	Wastewater sludge biogas is produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in wastewater. Wastewater (municipal/domestic) contains suspended solids, biodegradable organics, pathogens, nutrients, pollutants, refractory organics, heavy metals and dissolved inorganic compounds. It is a residue rich in organic matter that is mostly treated to produce clean water, as well as biogas as a by-product.
263130	Animal residue biogas				263100	Renewables	Animal residue biogas is biogas from the anaerobic digestion of animal residues, including manure, other bodily fluids, and corpses. Animal residues can be filtered for large solids, then processed through anaerobic digester tanks.
263140	Vegetal residue biogas				263100	Renewables	Vegetal residue biogas is the biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of any vegetal residue, including agricultural residues, crop residues and harvest residues. Where the residues come from vegetation used for energy purposes, these biogases should be considered secondary energy products.
263190	Other biogas from anaerobic digestion				263100	Renewables	Other biogases from anaerobic digestion are biogases produced from all other organic matter not elsewhere specified. Depending on the biomass feedstock, these biogases could be primary or secondary energy products.

263330	Bio-DME				263300	Renewables	Bio-dimethyl ether (bio-DME), also known as methoxymethane, wood ether, dimethyl oxide or methyl ether, is an ether with the chemical formula C2 H6 O. It is a colourless, slightly narcotic, non-toxic, highly flammable gas at ambient conditions, but it can be handled as a liquid when lightly pressurised (ETIP Bioenergy, n.d.)

264000	Renewable waste				260000	Renewables	Biodegradable waste fraction used for energy recovery
264100	Renewable municipal waste				264000	Renewables	Renewable municipal waste is municipal solid waste of biological origin that is used for energy. Municipal solid waste is collected from households and enterprises and is generally mixed, although waste of different types may be collected separately or sorted as part of the waste disposal process. Renewable municipal waste is the proportion of this total amount of waste that is of biological origin; it includes waste materials such as discarded food, paper and cardboard, disposable nappies, wooden articles, textiles, rubber and leather, and gardening waste.
264200	Renewable industrial waste				264000	Renewables	Renewable industrial waste is waste materials or heat of biological origin generated by industrial processes that can be used as a source of energy. If it is possible to classify the biological type of the waste, these energy products should be categorised within their own bioenergy section. The renewable industrial waste category serves as a group of unclassified products from industrial processes for which it is unfeasible to classify the type of energy product.
270000	Non-bio renewable fuels				200000	Renewables	Renewable synthetic fuels not derived from biological sources
271000	Non-bio renewable solid fuels				270000	Renewables	Non-bio renewable solid fuels is an aggregate group for solid state renewable synthetic fuels.

If the carbon is captured from the combustion of fossil fuels or biomass, such gasoline should be categorised as motor gasoline (114552) or as a type of biogasoline (262100), as appropriate.
272200	Non-bio renewable diesels				272000	Renewables	Non-bio renewable diesels are liquid fuels used in diesel engines that are synthesised with renewable non-bio hydrocarbons, such as atmospheric carbon.

273200	Renewable photolytic hydrogen				273000	Renewables	Renewable photolytic hydrogen is hydrogen produced using photoelectrochemical light systems that power water electrolysis.12 Semiconductor photoelectrodes submerged in an aqueous electrolyte can produce sufficient electricity for water electrolysis (Hand, 2008).
273300	Renewable thermolytic hydrogen				273000	Renewables	Renewable thermolytic hydrogen is hydrogen produced from the thermal decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. With enough heat to reach temperatures of 500-2000°C, and with the help of chemicals, water can be dissociated into its components: hydrogen and oxygen. Despite issues in this process, like corrosion and element toxicity, thermolysis shows promising energy efficiencies of between 20% and 45% (Shiva Kumar and Himabindu, 2019).
273400	Non-bio renewable ammonia				273000	Renewables	Non-bio renewable ammonia refers to all the ammonia produced for energy purposes when using hydrogen from any of the renewable hydrogen pathways.
273500	Non-bio renewable DME				273000	Renewables	Non-bio renewable dimethyl ether (DME) is the same molecule as bio-DME (263330). The distinction in the current category is that non-bio sources are used for DME production.

291000	Air-source heat pump		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2044954	air source heat pump | ASHP	290000	Renewables	Air-source heat pumps use the ambient air’s temperature as a source of heat or as a heat sink for the pump’s operation, depending on the ambient temperature and the need to heat or cool the other end of the thermodynamic cycle. If a pump can do both, it is referred to as a reversible heat pump. Air-source heat pumps are the most widely used heat pumps. Their efficiency depends on the ambient air’s temperature, and because this varies throughout the year, seasons and even days, their thermal efficiency varies throughout their operational use.
292000	Water-source heat pump		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60963457	water source heat pump	290000	Renewables	A water-source heat pump is a device that transfers space heat to or from lakes, ponds, rivers and oceans. Unlike air-source heat pumps, ambient temperature varies less in water sources, making water-source heat pumps a more predictable choice for thermal energy exchange throughout the year. Their thermodynamic cycle can be open loop or closed loop. In open-loop systems, the extracted water flows through the heat exchanger and returns colder to its source. Closed-loop systems involve submerged heat exchanger coils or plates in the water body, transferring heat without contact between the water and the working fluid.

311000	Supercapacitors		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q754523	supercapacitor | supercap | ultracap | ultracapacitor | Goldcap | SC	310000	Storage	Supercapacitors are devices that store electricity in the form of electrical charges between two electrodes separated by an electrical insulator and immersed in an electrolyte connecting the electrodes. The theory of supercapacitor storage is similar to electrochemical batteries, but rather than using chemical redox reactions for storage, supercapacitors use electrostatic capacitance.
319000	Other electric storage				310000	Storage	Other electric storage options not elsewhere specified.
320000	Electrochemical storage				300000	Storage	Electrochemical storage is the storage of electricity in electrochemical cells, colloquially referred to as batteries. These systems convert electrical energy to chemical potential energy through redox reactions. This energy is then reconverted to electricity when required. These cells are mainly composed of four parts: anode (negative electrode), cathode (positive electrode), electrolyte and electrode separator.
321000	Stationary electric batteries				320000	Storage	Stationary electric batteries are electrochemical cells, regardless of their chemistry, that are designed for fixed service locations (i.e. not habitually to be moved from place to place) and that are permanently connected to the electricity supply. Common uses for these systems include electricity backup services and short-term electricity storage in centralised or decentralised power generators. Examples include battery fields attached to electricity-generating plants or household batteries for mini-grids in rural areas or installed in households and buildings in urban areas.
322000	Mobile electric batteries				320000	Storage	Mobile electric batteries are electrochemical cells, regardless of their chemistry, that are mobile. Batteries in electric vehicles are the main example. These batteries have the potential to ease the loads of distribution and transmission grids, particularly for the transport sector.
329000	Other electrochemical storage				320000	Storage	Other electrochemical storage not elsewhere specified.
330000	Electromagnetic storage				300000	Storage	Electromagnetic storage refers to the storage of energy in the magnetic field of an inductor (Sabihuddin et al., 2015). Electromagnetic storage is usually only available for a short period of time, with the focus being improving the quality of power supply.
331000	Superconducting magnetic storage		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q915682	superconducting magnetic energy storage | SMES | SMESS	330000	Storage	Superconducting magnetic storage comprises systems that combine a superconductor, refrigeration, a containment vessel and a power converter to store electricity in a magnetic field (Xue et al., 2006). A magnetic field is generated by direct current electricity flowing through a superconducting coil. The coil is cryogenically cooled to reduce its electrical resistance. The stored electricity can be used by connecting the superconducting coil to an alternating current converter.
339000	Other electromagnetic storage				330000	Storage	Other electromagnetic storage not elsewhere specified.
340000	Mechanical storage				300000	Storage	This group includes energy storage options that use mechanical pathways to store energy and may include use of the kinetic energy of fluids or the potential energy of fluids and solids.

Although the energy used to pump water is greater than the energy obtained when it is released, pumped hydro is useful for managing variations in electricity supply and demand.
342000	Compressed fluids				340000	Storage	Compressed fluids use the kinetic energy of pressurised fluids to store energy. In practice, electricity is fed to a fluid compressor that increases the pressure and temperature of a fluid inside a vessel. The pressurised fluid particles have more kinetic energy, bouncing faster inside the vessel until they are channelled through a turbine and then to an electricity generator to produce electricity. Then, the exhausted particles can be returned to the vessel for further cycles of pressurisation.
343000	Flywheels		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183576	flywheel	340000	Storage	Flywheels are energy storage systems that store kinetic energy in a rotating mass. The mass can be rotated by an electric motor; electricity excess from diverse sources could be used for this purpose (Breeze, 2018). Modern flywheels use a bi-directional converter to power a motor using excess electricity (that could come from the grid) or alternatively, to direct electricity back to the grid from a generator inside the flywheel. In the case where the flywheel is being charged with excess electricity, the motor rotates a flywheel rotor housed inside a vacuumed container, converting electricity into kinetic energy, increasing the centripetal speed of the rotor. Then, when the electricity is needed, the sped up flywheel rotor turns an electricity generator, converting its kinetic energy back to electricity (Amiryar and Pullen, 2017).
344000	Gravitational storage				340000	Storage	Gravitational storage uses energy to increase the relative height of solid mass through hydraulic fluids and thus increase the potential energy of the mass, given its increased relative height. Because the potential energy of the mass is a product of the relative height difference, the gravitational force constant, and the weight of the mass, the heavier the mass and the higher it can be raised, the more energy can be stored. When the energy is needed, the solid mass is decreased to its baseline height while pushing the hydraulic fluid to a turbine, generating electricity.

351000	Latent heat storage				350000	Storage	Latent heat storage uses energy to heat a fluid or solid to a different physical state (from solid to liquid or gas, or from liquid to gas) using heat exchangers. When the energy is needed, these liquids or gases are returned to their initial physical phase by transferring heat to a colder working fluid. Latent heat is more effective at storing energy than sensible heat since, generally, it takes more energy to change physical phases at a same temperature than to raise the temperature of a substance without changing physical phases.
352000	Sensible heat storage				350000	Storage	Sensible heat storage comprises systems that use energy to heat a fluid or a solid to a higher temperature using heat exchangers and then keep the fluid or solid under thermally insulated conditions. When energy is needed, the heated fluids or solids transfer heat to a colder working fluid. This is particularly useful for heat end uses.
359000	Other thermal storage				350000	Storage	Other thermal storage options not elsewhere specified.
360000	Chemical fuels storage				300000	Storage	Chemical fuels storage is an aggregate group that includes storage as chemicals, particularly those from renewable sources.
361000	Hydrogen storage		https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1203442		360000	Storage	Hydrogen storage refers to hydrogen that is stored for energy uses. This hydrogen can come from either renewable or non-renewable sources, as classified in previous categories. At 120 MJ/kg (Rusman and Dahari, 2016),15 hydrogen is more energy dense by weight than other fuel sources but it is not as volume dense, making its storage a critical aspect of its feasibility as an energy source in economic, technical and safety terms.
361100	Gas hydrogen storage				361000	Storage	There are two common ways to physically store hydrogen gas under pressurised conditions without chemically modifying the hydrogen: in gas containers and in underground reservoirs.
361200	Liquid hydrogen storage				361000	Storage	Liquid hydrogen storage refers to hydrogen that is being stored in liquid state, usually in cryogenic tanks (Rusman and Dahari, 2016). At ambient pressure, hydrogen becomes liquid at temperatures close to absolute zero (around 20 K).
361300	Solid hydrogen storage				361000	Storage	Solid hydrogen storage refers to the storage of hydrogen in solid materials, mostly through the processes of absorption and adsorption. In this category are metal hydrides and adsorbents (Yue et al., 2021). This option is safer than traditional pressurised gas storage, but because of the metal requirements, it becomes a heavier choice that poses logistical transportation challenges.
361310	Metal hydride hydrogen storage				361300	Storage	Metal hydride hydrogen storage refers to the chemical storage of hydrogen in metal hydrides, often through absorption. At low temperatures, some metals react with hydrogen to form reversible solid metal-hydrogen compounds (Blackman et al., 2006), essentially capturing hydrogen molecules in the metal structures. There is ongoing research to solve some issues related to metal hydrides, such as slow reaction kinetics, low reversibility and high dehydrogenation temperatures (Ma et al., 2013; Principi et al., 2009).
361320	Adsorbent hydrogen storage				361300	Storage	Adsorbent hydrogen storage is the storage of hydrogen in solid materials, typically nano-engineered to optimise the adsorption of hydrogen, which could include carbon nanotubes and metal organic frameworks (Rusman and Dahari, 2016). The amount of hydrogen stored often depends on the pressure applied when injecting it onto these materials, but it is typically lower than pressurised hydrogen gas storage.

362000	Ammonia storage				360000	Storage	Ammonia storage refers to the use of ammonia to store energy for later use. Given the significant increase in the importance of variable renewable electricity, along with renewable hydrogen, and there being hydrogen and atmospheric air precursors in the synthesis of ammonia, this chemical has the potential to store large amounts of energy coming from renewable sources. Ammonia is also one of the most produced chemicals in the world with one of the longest manufacturing and storage experiences in industry, adding to its techno-economic attractiveness.
